# Sprint 4: Code Base Teardown & Architecture Analysis

**Learning Objectives**

By completing this assignment, you will:

1. **Reverse engineer** your own application to deeply understand its architecture
2. **Document** how all components work together using visual diagrams
3. **Teach back** your understanding through clear verbal explanation

**Expected Time Required**: 3-4 hours (2-3 hours analysis/documentation, 1 diagramming and video explanation)

**Points**: 40 points (8% of your grade)

**Overview**

You've built an MVP with a frontend, backend, database, and payment integration. Now it's time to **deepen your understanding of what you've created**.

This assignment asks you to:

1. **Dissect** your codebase using Claude Code. 
2. **Create an annotated architecture diagram** showing how everything connects
3. **Record a 2-3 minute video** walking through your diagram and explaining your app's architecture

**Why This Matters**: As a product manager working with engineers, you need to understand system architecture to make informed decisions about features, technical debt, scalability, and resource allocation. This assignment bridges the gap between "I built something with AI" and "I understand how systems work."

**Step 1: Code Base Analysis (AI-Assisted)**

Use Claude Code to analyze your codebase. Run the following 4 prompts to save the responses as markdown files. **Then read the newly created markdown files carefully, take the time to ask your preferred AI follow-up questions about things you don't understand.**

**Prompt 1: Project Structure Analysis**

```markdown
Analyze my project structure and provide:
1. A complete list of all directories and their purposes
2. The role of each major file in the codebase
3. Which files are frontend, backend, configuration, or deployment-related
4. A count of total lines of code (excluding dependencies/node_modules)

Format this as a clear outline I can reference and save it as a new markdown file called code-base-analysis.md. Explain things simply to a brand new beginner who is on a fast track to becoming a world class engineer.
```

**Prompt 2: Data Flow Analysis**

```markdown
Trace the complete data flow in my application:
1. What happens when a user first loads the app? (step-by-step)
2. What happens when a user performs the main action in my app? (trace from UI click to database and back)
3. Where does user authentication happen?
4. Where does payment processing happen?
5. What data is stored in the database and why?

Show me the flow with specific file names and function names. Save this as a new markdown file called data-flow-analysis.md. Explain things simply to a brand new beginner who is on a fast track to becoming a world class engineer.
```

**Prompt 3: Architecture Pattern Identification**

```markdown
Analyze my application architecture and identify:
1. What architectural pattern am I using? (e.g., MVC, client-server, serverless, monolith)
2. How is my code organized? (e.g., by feature, by layer, mixed)
3. What are the main components/modules and how do they interact?
4. Which parts of my code handle which responsibilities? (UI, business logic, data access, authentication, payments)
5. Are there any architectural anti-patterns or code smells I should be aware of?

Explain in terms I can understand as a product manager learning technical concepts. Save this as a new markdown file called architecture-pattern.md
```

**Prompt 4: Dependency Mapping**

```markdown
Create a comprehensive list of:
1. All external services my app depends on (Vercel, Supabase, Stripe, etc.)
2. All major libraries/packages and what they do
3. All API endpoints in my backend (list each route and its purpose)
4. All database tables and their relationships
5. Any third-party integrations

For each dependency, explain WHY it's needed and what would break if it failed. Save this as a new markdown file called dependency-mapping.md
```

**Step 2: Create an Architecture Diagram of your App**

Now use what you've learned from the AI responses to create a **visual architecture diagram**. You have two options:

**Option A: AI-Generated Diagram**

**Run the following prompt in Claude Code**

```markdown
Based on our analysis, create a visual architecture diagram for my application using Mermaid syntax.

The diagram should show:
1. Frontend components (user interface, forms, displays)
2. Backend API routes and their purposes
3. Database tables and what data they store
4. External services (Vercel, Supabase, Stripe, etc.)
5. Data flow arrows showing requests and responses
6. Authentication flow
7. Payment flow

Use the engineering landscape diagram style with clear sections for:
- Application Architecture (Frontend/Backend)
- Languages & Frameworks used
- External Services
- Database Schema
- Request/Response flows

Make it detailed enough to explain to a technical interviewer.
```

The AI will generate Mermaid code. Then ask:

```markdown
Convert this Mermaid diagram to a visual format I can export as a PNG or PDF.
OR
Show me how to render this Mermaid code as an image using an online tool.
```

**Option B: Manual Diagram Creation**

If you prefer to create the diagram manually, use any of the following tools or another one you prefer:

- [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/) - paste Mermaid code, export as PNG
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) - hand-drawn style diagrams
- [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) - professional diagrams
- PowerPoint/Google Slides - if you prefer manual creation

M



**Visual Style:**
- Use arrows to show direction of data flow
- Include labels and short descriptions where needed for clarity
- Make it visually clear and uncluttered

**Step 3: Video Walkthrough and Explanation**

Create a **2-3 minute video recording with screen share** where you walk through your architecture diagram and explain your application's architecture.

**Recording Tools (choose one):**

- **Loom** (recommended) - Free, easy, browser-based recording
- **Zoom** - Record yourself with screen share
- **QuickTime** (Mac) - Built-in screen recording

**What to Cover in Your Video**

Your video should address the following (think of it as teaching this to a classmate who hasn't seen your app):

**Introduction** (15-20 seconds)

- Brief description of what your app does

**Architecture Overview** (30-40 seconds)

- Screen share your diagram and explain the main sections

**Data Flow Walkthrough** (60-80 seconds)
Pick ONE main user action and trace it through the entire system:

**Example**: "Let me explain what happens when a user signs up and makes their first purchase..."

1. **User Action**: "User clicks 'Sign Up' on the frontend"
2. **Frontend → Backend**: "The form sends a POST request to my `/api/signup` endpoint"
3. **Authentication**: "The backend uses Supabase Auth to create the user account"
4. **Database**: "User data is stored in the `users` table with their email and password"
5. **Payment Flow**: "When they click 'Subscribe', we redirect to Stripe Checkout"
7. **Backend → Database**: "The backend updates the `subscriptions` table with their payment status"
8. **Response → Frontend**: "The user is redirected back to the app and sees their dashboard"

**Key Insights** (20-30 seconds)

- Mention one thing you learned from doing this analysis
- Mention one architectural decision you discovered about your app and why it matters
- Optional: Mention one thing you'd improve if you rebuilt this

**Submission**

Submit **TWO items** via LearningSuite:

1. Video Link (in a .txt or .md file)

- Upload your video to any platform and get a shareable link
- Upload your 4 md files you created containing your analysis.

**Alternative**: If LearningSuite accepts video uploads directly, you may upload the video file instead of a link.

## 💡 Tips for Success

### For Creating Your Diagram:
- **Start simple** - Map out the major pieces first, then add details
- **Use color coding** - Different colors for frontend, backend, database, external services
- **Think in flows** - Trace one user journey from start to finish
- **Ask AI for help** - Use the prompts above to generate a starting point
- **Iterate** - Your first diagram probably won't be perfect - revise it

### For Recording Your Video:
- **Write bullet points** - Not a script, just key points to cover
- **Practice once** - Do a dry run to get comfortable
- **Zoom in** - Make sure your diagram is readable in the recording
- **Use a pointer** - Your mouse cursor should guide viewers' eyes
- **Time yourself** - Aim for 2:30 to have buffer

### For Understanding Your Architecture:
- **Ask "why" questions** - Why did I use Supabase? Why is this in the backend not frontend?
- **Trace actual code** - Don't just describe theoretically - look at your actual files
- **Run your app** - Open DevTools and watch the network requests
- **Break something** - Turn off your backend and see what fails (then fix it!)

## 🤔 Reflection Questions (Not Graded - For Your Learning)

After completing this assignment, consider:

1. **What surprised you most about your own architecture?**
2. **What would you do differently if you built this app again from scratch?**
3. **Where is your app most vulnerable? What could break?**
4. **If you needed to add a new feature, what parts of the system would you need to modify?**
5. **How well does your architecture match the engineering landscape diagram we studied?**

---

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use AI to create the entire diagram?**
A: Yes! Use AI to generate the Mermaid code or create a starting point. But you must understand it enough to explain it in your video. AI is a tool, not a substitute for understanding.

**Q: What if my app doesn't have all the components (e.g., no payments)?**
A: Document what you DO have. If you don't have Stripe integration, explain your authentication flow in more detail. The goal is to show you understand YOUR specific architecture.

**Q: Can I edit my video or does it need to be one take?**
A: You can edit! Use Loom's editing features, or any video editor. Just keep the final video to 2-3 minutes.

**Q: What if I realize my app is poorly architected?**
A: That's a valuable insight! Mention it in your video. Showing you understand architectural trade-offs demonstrates learning.

**Q: How technical should my explanation be?**
A: Target your explanation at a **classmate** who understands basic web development concepts (frontend, backend, database) but hasn't seen your specific app. Use technical terms but explain them briefly.

**Q: My architecture diagram tool doesn't match the engineering landscape style exactly. Is that OK?**
A: Yes! The engineering landscape image is inspiration, not a template. Your diagram should clearly show YOUR app's architecture in a format that makes sense.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes Assessed

This assignment assesses:
- **Learning Outcome 4**: Create a digital product that delivers value to a target customer group
  - By demonstrating deep understanding of your own product's technical architecture
  - By documenting system design decisions
  - By communicating technical concepts clearly

---

**Remember**: The goal of this assignment is not to prove your app is perfectly architected. The goal is to demonstrate that you **understand how software systems work** by analyzing, documenting, and explaining the system you've built.

This is a critical skill for product managers who need to have technical conversations with engineering teams, make informed decisions about features and timelines, and understand the implications of architectural choices.

Good luck! 🚀
