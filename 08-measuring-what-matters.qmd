## Why This Matters

You can't improve what you don't measure. But measuring the wrong things is worse than measuring nothing—it leads you to optimize for metrics that don't matter while ignoring what does.

This chapter teaches you to choose the right metrics, avoid vanity traps, and implement analytics that actually inform decisions. The goal isn't to track everything; it's to track what helps you build a better product.

## Part 1: The Strategy

### The Metrics Hierarchy

Not all metrics are created equal. Think of them in layers:

```
                    North Star Metric
                          ↑
              Input Metrics (drivers)
                          ↑
        Operational Metrics (activities)
                          ↑
              Diagnostic Metrics (health checks)
```

**North Star Metric**: The one number that best captures the value you deliver to customers. For Airbnb, it's nights booked. For Slack, it's messages sent. For Spotify, it's time spent listening.

**Input Metrics**: The levers you can pull that influence the North Star. These are what you actually optimize.

**Operational Metrics**: Day-to-day activity indicators.

**Diagnostic Metrics**: Health checks that tell you if something's broken.

### Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Lagging** | Measures outcomes (what happened) | Revenue, churn rate |
| **Leading** | Predicts outcomes (what will happen) | Feature adoption, NPS |

**The insight:** Lagging indicators tell you the score. Leading indicators tell you how to change it.

If churn is your problem (lagging), look for leading indicators that predict it:
- Days since last login
- Features used (or not used)
- Support tickets filed
- Declining engagement

### Vanity Metrics vs. Actionable Metrics

**Vanity metrics** make you feel good but don't help you make decisions:
- Total registered users (includes inactive)
- Page views (without context)
- Social media followers
- App downloads

**Actionable metrics** inform decisions:
- Active users (DAU/WAU/MAU)
- Conversion rate
- Retention cohorts
- Time to value

**The test:** Can this metric directly inform a decision? If not, it's probably vanity.

### The Pirate Metrics Framework (AARRR)

Dave McClure's framework covers the entire user lifecycle:

| Stage | Question | Key Metrics |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Acquisition** | How do users find you? | Traffic sources, CAC, sign-ups |
| **Activation** | Do they have a good first experience? | Activation rate, time to value |
| **Retention** | Do they come back? | Day 1/7/30 retention, churn |
| **Revenue** | Do they pay? | Conversion, ARPU, LTV |
| **Referral** | Do they tell others? | NPS, referral rate, virality |

**Where to focus:** If you're pre-product-market fit, focus on Activation and Retention. Acquisition and Revenue come later.

### Acquisition Metrics

Measure how people discover and start using your product.

| Metric | What It Measures | Formula |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| **Traffic** | Visitors by source | Organic, paid, referral counts |
| **Sign-ups** | New account creation | Registrations per period |
| **CAC** | Cost to acquire a customer | Total acquisition spend / New customers |
| **Activation Rate** | First value experience | Users who complete key action / Total new users |

**Watch out for:** High acquisition + low activation = leaky bucket. Fix activation before spending more on acquisition.

### Engagement Metrics

Track how actively and frequently people interact with your product.

| Metric | What It Measures | Formula |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| **DAU/WAU/MAU** | Active users by timeframe | Unique users who performed core action |
| **Stickiness** | Habit formation | DAU / MAU (higher = stickier) |
| **Session length** | Depth of engagement | Average time per session |
| **Feature adoption** | Feature usage | Users who used feature / Total active users |

**DAU/MAU ratio benchmarks:**
- 50%+ = Excellent (daily habit)
- 20-50% = Good
- 10-20% = Average
- <10% = Concerning

### Retention Metrics

Measure how well your product keeps users coming back over time.

| Metric | What It Measures | Formula |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| **Retention rate** | Users who stayed | Users at end of period / Users at start |
| **Churn rate** | Users who left | Lost users / Total users |
| **Cohort retention** | Retention by signup date | % of cohort still active after N days |

**Cohort analysis** is your most powerful retention tool. Instead of looking at all users together, group them by when they signed up and track each group separately.

```
Cohort: January signups
Day 1:  100% (by definition)
Day 7:   60%
Day 30:  35%
Day 90:  20%
```

**Retention curves tell a story:**
- Steep initial drop → First experience problem
- Continued decline → Core value problem
- Flattening curve → Found your retained users
- Rising curve → You're doing something special

### Monetization Metrics

Reflect your ability to generate revenue.

| Metric | What It Measures | Formula |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| **Conversion rate** | Free to paid | Paying users / Total users |
| **ARPU** | Revenue per user | Revenue / Active users |
| **LTV** | Lifetime customer value | ARPU × Average customer lifespan |
| **LTV:CAC ratio** | Unit economics health | LTV / CAC (want 3:1 or better) |

**The LTV:CAC ratio** is crucial:
- < 1:1 = Losing money on each customer
- 1-3:1 = Concerning, watch carefully
- 3:1+ = Healthy, can invest in growth
- 5:1+ = Very healthy, maybe under-investing

### Customer Satisfaction Metrics

Track how users feel about your product.

| Metric | What It Measures | Scale |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| **NPS** | Likelihood to recommend | -100 to +100 |
| **CSAT** | Satisfaction with experience | 1-5 or 1-10 |
| **CES** | Effort to accomplish goal | 1-7 |

**Net Promoter Score (NPS):**
- "How likely are you to recommend us?" (0-10)
- Promoters (9-10), Passives (7-8), Detractors (0-6)
- NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors

**Benchmarks vary by industry:** A 30 NPS might be excellent for a bank but mediocre for a consumer app.

### Data-Informed vs. Data-Driven

**Data-driven:** "The data says X, so we do X."

**Data-informed:** "The data says X, and combined with our judgment about Y, we'll do Z."

The difference matters. Data can tell you *what* is happening, but rarely *why*. It can show *correlation* but not *causation*.

**When to trust data:**
- Large sample sizes
- Clear causation (A/B tests)
- Consistent patterns across time/segments

**When to be skeptical:**
- Small sample sizes
- Cherry-picked time periods
- Metrics that can be gamed
- Correlation without causation

### Choosing Your Metrics

For your sprint, focus on these questions:

1. **What's your North Star?** The one metric that best represents value delivered.
2. **What are your input metrics?** 2-3 things you can influence that drive the North Star.
3. **What's your activation event?** The moment users first get value.
4. **How will you measure retention?** Day 1, Day 7, Day 30 are common.

**Start simple.** It's better to track 5 metrics well than 50 poorly.

## Part 2: Building It

### Analytics Architecture

A typical analytics setup:

```
User Action
    ↓
Event Tracking (client-side)
    ↓
Analytics Service (Supabase, Mixpanel, PostHog)
    ↓
Dashboard (visualization)
    ↓
Decision
```

### Setting Up Analytics with Supabase

Supabase can serve as your analytics backend. Create an events table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE analytics_events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  event_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  event_data JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  page_url TEXT,
  session_id TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Index for fast queries
CREATE INDEX idx_events_name ON analytics_events(event_name);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_user ON analytics_events(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_time ON analytics_events(created_at);
```

### Event Tracking Implementation

Create an analytics utility:

```javascript
// lib/analytics.js
import { supabase } from './supabase';

let sessionId = null;

function getSessionId() {
  if (!sessionId) {
    sessionId = crypto.randomUUID();
  }
  return sessionId;
}

export async function trackEvent(eventName, eventData = {}) {
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();

  const { error } = await supabase.from('analytics_events').insert({
    user_id: user?.id,
    event_name: eventName,
    event_data: eventData,
    page_url: window.location.href,
    session_id: getSessionId()
  });

  if (error) {
    console.error('Analytics error:', error);
  }
}
```

### Tracking Key Events

Track events throughout your app:

```javascript
// Track sign-up
await trackEvent('user_signed_up', {
  method: 'email' // or 'google', 'github'
});

// Track activation (first value moment)
await trackEvent('activation_completed', {
  feature: 'first_problem_added'
});

// Track feature usage
await trackEvent('feature_used', {
  feature: 'problem_tracker',
  action: 'added_problem'
});

// Track conversions
await trackEvent('subscription_started', {
  plan: 'pro',
  monthly_value: 29
});
```

### Common Event Schema

Standardize your event names and properties:

| Event | Properties | When to Fire |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| `page_viewed` | `page_name`, `referrer` | Every page load |
| `user_signed_up` | `method` | Account creation |
| `user_logged_in` | `method` | Successful login |
| `activation_completed` | `feature` | First value moment |
| `feature_used` | `feature`, `action` | Feature interactions |
| `error_occurred` | `error_type`, `message` | Errors |

### Querying Your Data

Basic SQL queries for common metrics:

**Daily Active Users:**
```sql
SELECT DATE(created_at) as date, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as dau
FROM analytics_events
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date;
```

**Activation Rate:**
```sql
WITH signups AS (
  SELECT user_id, MIN(created_at) as signup_date
  FROM analytics_events
  WHERE event_name = 'user_signed_up'
  GROUP BY user_id
),
activations AS (
  SELECT user_id
  FROM analytics_events
  WHERE event_name = 'activation_completed'
)
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT activations.user_id)::FLOAT /
  COUNT(DISTINCT signups.user_id) as activation_rate
FROM signups
LEFT JOIN activations ON signups.user_id = activations.user_id;
```

**Retention by Cohort:**
```sql
WITH user_cohorts AS (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('week', MIN(created_at)) as cohort_week
  FROM analytics_events
  WHERE event_name = 'user_signed_up'
  GROUP BY user_id
),
user_activity AS (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('week', created_at) as activity_week
  FROM analytics_events
  GROUP BY user_id, DATE_TRUNC('week', created_at)
)
SELECT
  uc.cohort_week,
  ua.activity_week,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ua.user_id) as active_users
FROM user_cohorts uc
JOIN user_activity ua ON uc.user_id = ua.user_id
WHERE ua.activity_week >= uc.cohort_week
GROUP BY uc.cohort_week, ua.activity_week
ORDER BY uc.cohort_week, ua.activity_week;
```

### Building a Simple Dashboard

Create a dashboard component in React:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { supabase } from '../lib/supabase';

export function MetricsDashboard() {
  const [metrics, setMetrics] = useState({
    dau: 0,
    signups: 0,
    activations: 0
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchMetrics() {
      // Daily Active Users (last 24 hours)
      const { count: dau } = await supabase
        .from('analytics_events')
        .select('user_id', { count: 'exact', head: true })
        .gte('created_at', new Date(Date.now() - 86400000).toISOString());

      // Signups (last 7 days)
      const { count: signups } = await supabase
        .from('analytics_events')
        .select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true })
        .eq('event_name', 'user_signed_up')
        .gte('created_at', new Date(Date.now() - 604800000).toISOString());

      // Activations (last 7 days)
      const { count: activations } = await supabase
        .from('analytics_events')
        .select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true })
        .eq('event_name', 'activation_completed')
        .gte('created_at', new Date(Date.now() - 604800000).toISOString());

      setMetrics({ dau, signups, activations });
    }

    fetchMetrics();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
      <MetricCard title="Daily Active Users" value={metrics.dau} />
      <MetricCard title="Signups (7d)" value={metrics.signups} />
      <MetricCard title="Activations (7d)" value={metrics.activations} />
    </div>
  );
}

function MetricCard({ title, value }) {
  return (
    <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow">
      <h3 className="text-sm text-gray-500">{title}</h3>
      <p className="text-2xl font-bold">{value}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Alternative: Third-Party Analytics

For more features without building custom:

| Service | Best For | Free Tier |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **PostHog** | Product analytics, open source | 1M events/mo |
| **Mixpanel** | Event-based analytics | 100K users/mo |
| **Amplitude** | Product analytics at scale | 10M events/mo |
| **Plausible** | Simple, privacy-focused | Paid only |
| **Google Analytics** | Basic web analytics | Unlimited |

### PostHog Integration Example

```bash
npm install posthog-js
```

```javascript
// lib/posthog.js
import posthog from 'posthog-js';

export function initPostHog() {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    posthog.init('your-project-key', {
      api_host: 'https://app.posthog.com'
    });
  }
}

export function trackEvent(event, properties) {
  posthog.capture(event, properties);
}

export function identifyUser(userId, traits) {
  posthog.identify(userId, traits);
}
```
