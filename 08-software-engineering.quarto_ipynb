        "## Introduction: Thinking like a Software Engineer\n",
        "\n",
        "What comes to mind when you think of software engineering? Most people immediately think of one thing--writing code. However, \"writing code\" does not fully encapsulate the work of a software engineer. At its core, software engineering is all about designing solutions to complex problems in a way that others can understand and improve upon over time. Whether you're building a personal project or contributing to a larger application, you should always keep these four essential questions in mind:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Can others understand my code?** Will someone else (or future you) be able to read and modify this code easily?\n",
        "-   **Is it scalable?** As my user base grows, will my code still work efficiently?\n",
        "-   **Does it handle errors?** When something goes wrong, does my code deal with it gracefully instead of crashing?\n",
        "-   **Does it work fast?** Is my code efficient and doesn't waste computer resources?\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding the fundamentals of software engineering is essential to allow you to use AI to its fullest capacity. This chapter explores those fundamental ideas and best practices needed to write robust and maintainable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Programming Basics\n",
        "\n",
        "### Variables, Functions, Conditionals, Loops\n",
        "\n",
        "The building blocks of any program are variables, functions, conditionals, and loops. Below is a brief introduction to each programming concept, along with some practical examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "> \\*\\* About the Code Examples\\*\\*\n",
        ">\n",
        "> In the code examples throughout this chapter, we will use JavaScript with Next.js, a popular React framework for building modern web applications. Keep in mind though, any programming language will adhere to the same fundamental principles, though the syntax may vary.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Variables** store data in your program. Choose descriptive names that clearly indicate what the variable contains:\n",
        "\n",
        "```{javascript}\n",
        "// Good - Names clearly describe what the data represents\n",
        "const userAge = 25;                    // Age of the user\n",
        "const isAuthenticated = true;          // Whether user is logged in\n",
        "const customerEmail = \"john@example.com\"; // User's email address\n",
        "\n",
        "// Poor - Unclear names that don't explain the data\n",
        "const x = 25;        // What does x represent?\n",
        "const flag = true;   // What is this flag for?\n",
        "const data = \"john@example.com\"; // What kind of data?\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Functions** are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Good functions follow these principles:\n",
        "\n",
        "```{javascript}\n",
        "// This function has one clear job: calculate a price with tax and discount\n",
        "// It takes three inputs (parameters) and returns the final price\n",
        "function calculateTotalPrice(basePrice, taxRate, discountPercentage = 0) {\n",
        "    // First, apply the discount (if any)\n",
        "    const discountedPrice = basePrice * (1 - discountPercentage / 100);\n",
        "    \n",
        "    // Then, add tax to the discounted price\n",
        "    const totalWithTax = discountedPrice * (1 + taxRate);\n",
        "    \n",
        "    // Round to 2 decimal places for currency display\n",
        "    return Math.round(totalWithTax * 100) / 100;\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "// Usage example:\n",
        "const finalPrice = calculateTotalPrice(100, 0.08, 10); // $100 base, 8% tax, 10% discount\n",
        "console.log(finalPrice); // Result: $97.20\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conditionals** let your program make decisions based on different situations:\n",
        "\n",
        "```{javascript}\n",
        "// Check user's age and respond appropriately\n",
        "if (userAge >= 18) {\n",
        "    console.log(\"User is an adult\");\n",
        "} else if (userAge >= 13) {\n",
        "    console.log(\"User is a teenager\");\n",
        "} else {\n",
        "    console.log(\"User is a child\");\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "// This creates different behavior based on the userAge value\n",
        "// 25 → \"User is an adult\"\n",
        "// 16 → \"User is a teenager\" \n",
        "// 8 → \"User is a child\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Loops** repeat actions efficiently instead of writing the same code multiple times:\n",
        "\n",
        "```{javascript}\n",
        "// For loop: when you know exactly how many times to repeat\n",
        "for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n",
        "    console.log(`Iteration ${i}`); // Prints: Iteration 0, Iteration 1, etc.\n",
        "}\n",
        "\n",
        "// While loop: when you repeat until a condition is met\n",
        "let userInput = \"\";\n",
        "while (userInput !== \"quit\") {\n",
        "    userInput = prompt(\"Enter command (or 'quit' to exit): \");\n",
        "    processCommand(userInput);\n",
        "}\n",

        "```\n",

        "### Components in Next.js\n",
        "\n",
        "In Next.js, **components** are like custom LEGO blocks for building websites. Each component is a piece of your website that can be reused and combined with other pieces.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of a component like a recipe that describes: - What it looks like (the display) - What data it needs (like ingredients) - What it can do (like buttons that respond to clicks)\n",
