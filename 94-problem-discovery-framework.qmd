## Theoretical Foundation

### Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan)

Three universal human needs that drive motivation and wellbeing:

| Human Need | Definition | Gospel Framing |
|---|---|---|
| **Autonomy** | Control over your life and choices | **Agency** — moral agency, stewardship |
| **Competence** | Growth, mastery, becoming more capable | **Becoming** — eternal progression, growing toward divine potential |
| **Relatedness** | Connection to others, belonging | **Connection** — covenant relationships, community |

### Core Insight

**The user is always an individual.** Households and organizations don't click buttons — people do. SDT applies regardless of context (personal, household, or work).

---

## Theory of the Firm

Organizations exist to **create value** and **capture a portion of it** (Brandenburger & Stuart 1996, Teece 2010).

The Work sub-domains map to these two goals:

| Goal | Activities |
|---|---|
| **Create Value** | Discovering, Designing, Producing |
| **Capture Value** | Acquiring, Delivering, Retaining |

B2B products solve friction at the intersection of an **organizational activity** and an **employee's unmet human need**.

## Opportunity Signals

Both frustration and delight are valid signals pointing to product opportunities:

| Signal | Opportunity Type | Product Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| **Frustration** | Pain Reliever | Reduce friction; remove obstacles; solve problems |
| **Delight** | Gain Creator | Amplify joy; create more of what works; enhance experiences |

::: {.callout-tip title="Frustration AND Delight"}
Problems aren't only about pain. A frustration points to a **pain reliever** product. A delight points to a **gain creator** product. Both are valid starting points.

## Scoring

### Opportunity Score (1–5 scales)

| Score | Frequency | Intensity (Frustration) | Intensity (Delight) | Willingness to Pay | Market Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Rarely | Shrug | Meh | Wouldn't pay | Just me |
| 2 | Yearly | Minor annoyance | Mildly pleasant | Unlikely to pay | Small niche |
| 3 | Monthly | Annoying | Enjoyable | Might pay | Moderate group |
| 4 | Weekly | Frustrating | Love it | Probably would pay | Large segment |
| 5 | Daily | I hate this | Can't live without | Already paying for solutions | Widespread |

### Conviction Score (0/1 checkboxes, sum of 4)

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Personal Pain | You live this problem yourself |
| Close Relationship | Someone you love experiences this |
| Moral Calling | You believe it's wrong that this problem exists |
| Unique Insight or Skills | You see something others don't, or your skills position you to solve this |

| Sum | Level | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| 0–1 | Low | Weak foundation — reconsider |
| 2 | Moderate | Worth exploring further |
| 3–4 | High | Strong conviction to pursue |

### Technical Feasibility (0/1 checkboxes, sum of 3)

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Data/API Access | I can get the data or API access I need |
| Technology Readiness | Tech is good enough to deliver a great experience |
| No Hardware or Regulatory Blockers | Does not require unavailable hardware or regulatory approval |

| Sum | Level | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | Clear | Clear path to build |
| 1–2 | Caution | Some challenges — have a plan |
| 0 | Blocked | Major concerns — reconsider or simplify |

## Gospel Framework

Three directional checks rooted in Self-Determination Theory and alignment with gospel principles:

| Column | Gospel Root | Question |
|---|---|---|
| **Expands Agency** | Agency | Does my value proposition expand what users can do and choose? |
| **Supports Becoming** | Becoming | Does my value proposition help users genuinely grow? |
| **Deepens Connection** | Connection | Does my value proposition strengthen real relationships? |

### Key Principles

- **Not every product needs all three.** Pure tools (Uber, Amazon) may only expand agency — that's fine.
- **The question is directional.** For the needs you DO touch, are you on the right side?
- **Design details matter.** The same product type can be either beneficial or harmful.
- **Dependency is not inherently bad.** Electricity creates dependency AND expands agency. The test is whether the dependency empowers or exploits.
- **Principles from D&C 121:** Persuasion, long-suffering, love unfeigned — the relationship between product and user should be one of genuine service, not extraction.
