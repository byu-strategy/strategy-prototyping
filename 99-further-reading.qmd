**Claude Code: What It Is, How It's Different, and Why Non-Technical People Should Use It**

**Author:** Teresa Torres

**Published:** October 29, 2025

**Source:** Product Talk

This article explains how Claude Code differs from browser-based Claude by enabling automatic file access, parallel task processing, and reusable workflows. Torres demonstrates these capabilities through a detailed competitive analysis example and emphasizes that you don't need coding experience, just basic familiarity with file organization and simple terminal commands.

**Specification-Driven Development (SDD)**

**Source:** GitHub Spec Kit

This comprehensive guide articulates a fundamental shift in software development methodology where specifications become the primary artifact that generates code, rather than code being produced from specifications. The document introduces practical workflows with automated commands (`/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`) and a constitutional framework with nine core articles that enforce development discipline. This resource demonstrates how templates and structured thinking can guide AI toward higher-quality specifications, creating a repeatable methodology for bridging the gap between requirements and implementation.
