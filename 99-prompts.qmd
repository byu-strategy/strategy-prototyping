## Architecture

Open ChatGPT (4o, not o1/o3/o4) and say:

“ I’m building a [description of your product - the more detailed the better]. Use Next.js for frontend, Supabase for DB + auth. 

Give me the full architecture:

- File + folder structure
- What each part does
- Where state lives, how services connect

Format this entire document in markdown.”

Save its output as architecture.md and throw it in an empty folder where your project will live.

## Tasks

“ Using that architecture, write a granular step-by-step plan to build the MVP.
Each task should:

- Be incredibly small + testable
- Have a clear start + end
- Focus on one concern

I’ll be passing this off to an engineering LLM that will be told to complete one task at a time, allowing me to test in between. "

Save it as tasks.md. Again, throw it in the folder.

## Engineering

Step 3: In Cursor/Windsurf

“ You’re an engineer building this codebase.

You've been given architecture.md and tasks.md.

- Read both carefully. There should be no ambiguity about what we’re building.
- Follow http://tasks.md and complete one task at a time.
- After each task, stop. I’ll test it. If it works, commit to GitHub and move to the next. "

Include this as well - this is crucial:

 CODING PROTOCOL

" Coding Instructions

- Write the absolute minimum code required
- No sweeping changes
- No unrelated edits - focus on just the task you're on
- Make code precise, modular, testable
- Don’t break existing functionality
- If I need to do anything (e.g. Supabase/AWS config), tell me clearly  "

This system fixes the biggest problem with vibe coding:

You’re not dumping everything into the IDE and praying.
You’re giving it a roadmap.
You’re keeping it on rails.
You stay in control.

This workflow lets you ship clean, testable AI-assisted code - without the spiral.

Normally I'd ask you to follow me for the playbook but this is literally it. Good luck
