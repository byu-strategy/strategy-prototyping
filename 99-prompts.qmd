## Architecture

Open ChatGPT (4o, not o1/o3/o4) and say:

‚Äú I‚Äôm building a [description of your product - the more detailed the better]. Use Next.js for frontend, Supabase for DB + auth. 

Give me the full architecture:

- File + folder structure
- What each part does
- Where state lives, how services connect

Format this entire document in markdown.‚Äù

Save its output as architecture.md and throw it in an empty folder where your project will live.

## Tasks

‚Äú Using that architecture, write a granular step-by-step plan to build the MVP.
Each task should:

- Be incredibly small + testable
- Have a clear start + end
- Focus on one concern

I‚Äôll be passing this off to an engineering LLM that will be told to complete one task at a time, allowing me to test in between. "

Save it as tasks.md. Again, throw it in the folder.

## Engineering

Step 3: In Cursor/Windsurf

‚Äú You‚Äôre an engineer building this codebase.

You've been given architecture.md and tasks.md.

- Read both carefully. There should be no ambiguity about what we‚Äôre building.
- Follow http://tasks.md and complete one task at a time.
- After each task, stop. I‚Äôll test it. If it works, commit to GitHub and move to the next. "

Include this as well - this is crucial:

 CODING PROTOCOL

" Coding Instructions

- Write the absolute minimum code required
- No sweeping changes
- No unrelated edits - focus on just the task you're on
- Make code precise, modular, testable
- Don‚Äôt break existing functionality
- If I need to do anything (e.g. Supabase/AWS config), tell me clearly  "

This system fixes the biggest problem with vibe coding:

You‚Äôre not dumping everything into the IDE and praying.
You‚Äôre giving it a roadmap.
You‚Äôre keeping it on rails.
You stay in control.

This workflow lets you ship clean, testable AI-assisted code - without the spiral.

Normally I'd ask you to follow me for the playbook but this is literally it. Good luck

## Icons

[AirBnB-style icons with ChatGPT-4o in 60 seconds üëá](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nigolos_ffffff-activity-7331341131089076226-G6AC?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAABxVuoByW5PDRHey5Wh_ef3dPtGKfJRCmw)

I used just ONE simple prompt to create 3D isometric illustrations that feel like Pixar vibes mixed with modern, minimal design.

Use this prompt:

Generate [ Your Concept ] icon with this JSON style:

```{json}
{  
  "icon_style": {  
    "perspective": "isometric",  
    
    "geometry": {  
      "proportions": "1:1 ratio canvas, with objects fitting comfortably within margins",

    },  
    
    "composition": {  
      "element_count": "2‚Äì4 main objects",  
      "spatial_depth": "layered to create sense of dimension and slight elevation",

    }  
  }  
}
```

Just swap [ Your Concept ] with what you want:
‚Ä¢ ‚Äúcoffee shop‚Äù
‚Ä¢ ‚Äúbike rental‚Äù
‚Ä¢ ‚Äúco-working space‚Äù

And just like that, high-end, Airbnb-style icons are ready in seconds.
This might be the easiest design cheat code of 2025.
