# B2B Problem Discovery Framework

## Theory of the Firm (Two-Part)

Organizations exist to **create value** and **capture a portion of it**.

This is the academically grounded framing from strategy literature (Brandenburger & Stuart 1996, Teece 2010, Lepak et al. 2007).

## One Level Down: Core Activities

### CREATE VALUE (make something worth having)

| Activity | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Discover** | Understand what customers need, sense opportunities |
| **Design** | Define the solution - what to build and how |
| **Produce** | Build, manufacture, develop the product/service |

### CAPTURE VALUE (complete the exchange, get paid)

| Activity | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Acquire** | Find customers, generate demand, close sales |
| **Deliver** | Fulfill the promise - logistics, onboarding, deployment |
| **Retain** | Keep customers - support, success, renewals |

## Mapping to Self-Determination Theory

Employees are still humans. They have the same three universal psychological needs (Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness) - just expressed in a work context.

| Activity | Autonomy (Agency) | Competence (Becoming) | Relatedness (Connection) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Discover** | Freedom to explore, choose methods, follow hunches | Accurate insights, good predictions, research mastery | Customer empathy, team alignment on findings |
| **Design** | Creative ownership, design decisions, vision control | Craft mastery, good design choices, seeing work ship | Stakeholder collaboration, user connection |
| **Produce** | Control over how work gets done, tool choices | Technical mastery, shipping quality, efficiency gains | Team coordination, peer feedback, collective pride |
| **Acquire** | Territory ownership, strategy choices, approach control | Closing deals, hitting quota, pitch mastery | Customer relationships, team camaraderie, recognition |
| **Deliver** | Handling exceptions, process judgment, prioritization | On-time delivery, smooth handoffs, zero defects | Customer transitions, cross-functional coordination |
| **Retain** | Problem-solving autonomy, escalation judgment | Resolution rates, product expertise, CSAT scores | Deep customer relationships, knowledge sharing |

## Where B2B Products Win

B2B products solve friction at the intersection of an **activity** and a **need**.

| Example Product | Activity | Need Addressed |
|---|---|---|
| Figma | Design | Relatedness (real-time collaboration) |
| Salesforce | Acquire | Competence (track progress, hit quota) |
| Notion | Produce | Autonomy (work your way) |
| Zendesk | Retain | Competence (resolve tickets efficiently) |
| Slack | All | Relatedness (team connection) |
| Asana | Produce | Autonomy + Competence (organize work, see progress) |

## Finding B2B Problems (For Students)

1. Pick an **activity** where you have experience (internship, job, side project)
2. Reflect on what frustrated you
3. Which **need** was unmet?
   - **Autonomy**: Were you blocked from doing it your way?
   - **Competence**: Were you prevented from getting better or seeing progress?
   - **Relatedness**: Were you isolated, disconnected, or unrecognized?

The intersection of activity + unmet need = potential B2B problem worth solving.
