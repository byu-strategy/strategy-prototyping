# Go-to-Market Strategy

### STRAT 490R
Scott Murff

## The GTM Reality Check

You've built something. The product works. Users seem to like it.

And then... crickets.

. . .

**Building the product is only half the battle.**

**Getting people to use and pay for it is the other half.**

## Common Myths Founders Believe

**Myth #1: "If we build it, they will come."**

Reality: No they won't. You have to go find them.

. . .

**Myth #2: "We just need to go viral."**

Reality: Viral growth is not a strategy. Plan for the hard work first.

. . .

**Myth #3: "Marketing is just posting on social media."**

Reality: Marketing is understanding your customer deeply, crafting the right message, and delivering it through the right channels.

## The GTM Framework

A solid go-to-market strategy answers four core questions:

1. **Who** is your customer?
2. **Why** should they care?
3. **How** will you reach them?
4. **What** will make them stick?

# Know Your Customer (Really)

## The ICP: Ideal Customer Profile

Most founders think they know their customer. They don't.

. . .

**Vague ideas don't help:**
- "Small business owners"
- "College students"
- "Busy professionals"

. . .

**You need specificity.**

## B2B ICP Example

- **Company size:** 10-50 employees
- **Industry:** SaaS startups in the productivity space
- **Revenue:** $1M-$5M ARR
- **Pain point:** Struggling to manage customer onboarding at scale
- **Budget authority:** Head of Customer Success or COO
- **Tech stack:** Uses Slack, Notion, and a CRM

## B2C ICP Example

- **Demographics:** 22-28 years old, recent college grads
- **Location:** Urban areas, US-based
- **Behavior:** Actively job searching, checks LinkedIn daily
- **Pain point:** Overwhelmed by application tracking and interview prep
- **Willingness to pay:** $10-20/month for tools that save time

## Jobs-to-be-Done Framework

People don't buy a product—they hire it to do a job.

. . .

**Classic example:**
People don't want a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole. Actually, they don't even want the hole—they want to hang a picture so their living room feels complete.

. . .

**The JTBD template:**

*When I [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [desired outcome].*

## Using AI for Customer Research

AI becomes a superpower for early-stage founders:

1. **Generate initial customer personas** based on your assumptions
2. **Simulate customer interviews** to test your messaging
3. **Analyze customer feedback** from reviews, support tickets, or social media
4. **Identify pain points** by scraping competitor reviews or Reddit threads

. . .

**But remember:** Use AI to accelerate hypothesis generation, then validate with 5-10 real customer conversations.

## Quick Validation Techniques

**1. The Mom Test**

Ask about past behavior, not hypotheticals.

- Bad: "Would you use this?"
- Good: "Tell me about the last time you struggled with [problem]. What did you do?"

. . .

**2. Landing Page Test**
Build a simple landing page with "Join the waitlist." Drive traffic. See if people sign up.

. . .

**3. Smoke Test**
Offer "pre-order" or "early access" and see if people commit. Financial commitment is the strongest signal.

# Positioning & Messaging

## The Positioning Statement Formula

**For [target customer] who [pain point], [product name] is a [category] that [key benefit]. Unlike [alternatives], we [unique differentiator].**

. . .

**Example:**

*For freelance designers who struggle to track billable hours, TimeStack is a time-tracking app that automates logging with AI. Unlike Toggl or Harvest, we integrate directly into Figma and Adobe Creative Cloud, so you never have to manually start a timer.*

## Feature-Focused vs Benefit-Focused

**Bad messaging (feature-focused):**

"TimeStack uses AI to automatically log your hours across multiple apps."

. . .

**Good messaging (benefit-focused):**

"Never forget to track time again. TimeStack logs your hours automatically, so you get paid for every minute you work."

. . .

The bad version talks about *what* the product does.
The good version talks about *why it matters* to the customer.

## The "So What?" Test

For every sentence in your messaging, ask "So what?"

. . .

**Example:**

- "We use machine learning to categorize your tasks." → So what?
- "So you don't have to manually tag every entry." → So what?
- "So you save 30 minutes a week and get back to designing."

. . .

Now you've got a message that resonates.

## AI-Assisted Copywriting

**Generate multiple variations quickly:**

> "Write five different homepage headlines for a time-tracking app for freelancers. Emphasize saving time and getting paid accurately."

. . .

**A/B test messaging with synthetic users:**

> "I'm deciding between these two headlines: [A] 'Never miss billable hours again' vs [B] 'Get paid for every minute you work.' Which resonates more with a freelance designer earning $75K/year?"

. . .

Not a replacement for real A/B testing, but a useful gut check.

## Pricing Strategies

**1. Cost-Plus Pricing**
Calculate costs + add margin. Simple, but ignores what customers are willing to pay.

**2. Value-Based Pricing**
Price based on the value you deliver. If you save $10K/year, charging $2K/year feels like a steal.

**3. Competitive Pricing**
Look at competitors and price slightly below (penetration) or above (premium).

. . .

**For startups:** Start with value-based pricing. Ask 10 customers: "If this saved you X hours or $Y dollars, what would you expect to pay?"

# Choosing Your Channel Strategy

## The Channel Decision Tree

**1. Where does your customer spend time?**

- B2B SaaS: LinkedIn, industry newsletters, Slack communities
- Consumer apps: Social Media, Reddit, Product Hunt
- Technical users: Hacker News, GitHub, Stack Overflow

. . .

**2. What's your CAC tolerance?**

- Low budget: content marketing, organic social, partnerships
- High budget: paid ads, influencer marketing, conferences

## Product-Led vs Sales-Led

**Product-Led Growth (PLG):**

Users can sign up, try, and get value *without* talking to a salesperson.

**When PLG works:**

- Self-serve onboarding
- Time-to-value is short (minutes to hours)
- Users can experience the "aha moment" on their own
- Targeting individuals or small teams

. . .

Examples: Notion, Figma, Slack

## Sales-Led Growth (SLG)

**Sales-Led Growth:**

You proactively reach out, run demos, and close deals through human interaction.

**When SLG works:**

- Product is complex and requires setup or training
- Deal sizes are $10K+ annually
- Selling to enterprises with long procurement cycles
- Need to educate buyers on a new category

. . .

Examples: Salesforce, enterprise software

## Digital Channels for Student Startups

**Content Marketing (Blog, SEO)**
Effort: High | Time: 3-6 months | Cost: Free

**Social Media (LinkedIn, Twitter/X)**
Effort: Medium | Time: 2-4 months | Cost: Free

**Paid Ads (Google, Meta, LinkedIn)**
Effort: Medium | Time: Immediate | Cost: $500+

**Cold Outreach (Email, LinkedIn DMs)**
Effort: High | Time: Immediate | Cost: Free

**Community and Word-of-Mouth**
Effort: Medium | Time: 1-3 months | Cost: Free

## Common Mistake: Spreading Too Thin

The biggest mistake is trying every channel at once.

. . .

**Better approach:**

- Pick 1-2 channels
- Commit for 4-6 weeks
- Measure results
- If it's not working, kill it and try something else

. . .

**Depth > breadth**

## AI Tools for Channel Optimization

**For content marketing:**

- ChatGPT/Claude for blog outlines, SEO keywords, headlines

**For cold outreach:**

- ChatGPT to personalize cold email templates
- Lavender or Smartwriter for email optimization

**For paid ads:**

- ChatGPT to generate 10 variations of ad copy

**For social media:**

- ChatGPT to repurpose long-form content into threads and posts

# Your First 10 Customers

## Outbound Tactics ($0 Budget)

**1. Personal Network**
Message 20 people today. Not with a pitch—with a question:

> "Hey [Name], I'm working on [product] for [customer type]. Do you know anyone who struggles with [pain point]?"

. . .

**2. Cold Email**
Find emails using Hunter.io or Apollo. Keep it short:

> Subject: Quick question about [pain point]
> Hi [Name], I noticed you [relevant observation]. I'm building [product] to help with [pain point]. Would you be open to a 15-minute demo?

## More Outbound Tactics

**3. LinkedIn DMs**
Connect with your ICP. Send a brief, non-salesy message:

> "Hi [Name], saw your post about [topic]. I'm building something for [customer type]—would love your feedback if you have 10 minutes."

. . .

**4. Join Where Your Customers Are**
Find niche communities (Slack, Discord, subreddits) and *be helpful first*. Answer questions, share insights. After building trust, mention your product when relevant.

## Building Inbound Momentum

**1. Start a blog (SEO basics)**

- Target low-competition, high-intent keywords
- Instead of "time tracking software" → try "time tracking for freelance designers"

. . .

**2. Share your journey publicly**

Build in public on Twitter/X or LinkedIn:

- "Just talked to our 5th potential customer. Here's what I learned..."
- "Built our landing page in 2 hours with Webflow + ChatGPT. Here's the before/after."

. . .

**3. Create a lead magnet**
Offer something valuable in exchange for an email (free template, guide, community access)

## The 15-Minute Demo Structure

1. **Set the stage (1 min):** "Tell me about how you currently handle [pain point]?"

2. **Listen and adapt (3 min):** Let them talk. Take notes. Adjust your demo.

3. **Show, don't tell (7 min):** Walk through the product focused on *their* use case. Highlight the "aha moment."

4. **Handle objections (2 min):** Address questions directly.

5. **Ask for the close (2 min):** "Does this solve [pain]? Want to try it for a week?"

## Handling Common Objections

**"It's too expensive."**
→ "What's it worth to you to solve [pain]? How much time/money are you losing now?"

. . .

**"I need to think about it."**
→ "Totally fair. What specifically do you need to think through? Maybe I can help."

. . .

**"We're already using [competitor]."**
→ "Got it. What's working? What's not? Here's how we're different…"

## Using AI for Prospecting

**Generate personalized emails at scale:**

> "Write a cold email to a Head of Customer Success at a 50-person SaaS company. Mention their recent LinkedIn post about onboarding challenges."

. . .

**Research prospects faster:**

> "Summarize this LinkedIn profile and suggest three personalized talking points I can use in a cold email."

. . .

**Draft follow-ups automatically:**

> "Write a polite follow-up email to someone who didn't respond to my initial demo request."

# Launch & Iterate

## The Lean Launch Playbook

**Phase 1: Private Beta (Weeks 1-2)**
Invite 10-20 users by hand. Get feedback. Fix bugs. Improve onboarding.

. . .

**Phase 2: Public Beta (Weeks 3-4)**
Open to anyone, but set expectations. Use a waitlist to build anticipation.

. . .

**Phase 3: Official Launch (Week 5+)**
Announce via Product Hunt, Hacker News, LinkedIn, newsletters.

. . .

**Pro tip:** Launch multiple times. Each launch is a new chance to get attention.

## Metrics That Matter

**1. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
Total marketing spend ÷ number of new customers

**2. Lifetime Value (LTV)**
Average revenue per user × average customer lifespan

**3. LTV:CAC Ratio**
Goal: LTV should be at least 3x CAC

**4. Conversion Rates**
Track: Landing page → sign-up → activation → paid conversion

**5. Retention and Churn**
How many users stick around?

**6. North Star Metric**
The one metric that best captures the value your product delivers

## When to Pivot Your GTM

**Signs you need to pivot:**

- CAC is way higher than LTV
- Conversion rates are below 1% despite testing
- Customers sign up but don't use the product
- You're getting feedback that your positioning is off

. . .

**How to pivot:**

1. Go back to customers. Do 10 more interviews.
2. Test a new channel (if current one isn't working after 6 weeks).
3. Rewrite messaging based on actual customer language.
4. Narrow or shift your ICP.

## AI for Analytics and Experimentation

**Identify patterns in data:**

> "Here's our weekly sign-up data for the past 8 weeks: [paste data]. What patterns or anomalies do you see?"

. . .

**Suggest experiment ideas:**

> "Our landing page converts at 2%. What are five experiments I could run to improve this?"

. . .

**Summarize user feedback:**

> "Here are 20 user feedback responses: [paste]. Summarize the top 3 themes and suggest product improvements."
