## Introduction

The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management tool that helps you describe, design, challenge, and pivot your business model. Created by Alexander Osterwalder and refined by Jeff Dyer, it provides a visual framework for understanding how your organization creates, delivers, and captures value.

This version incorporates Jeff Dyer's refinement which splits the central value proposition into two distinct components: **Jobs-To-Be-Done** (understanding what customers are hiring your product to do) and **Customer Value Proposition** (the specific solutions you provide). This creates a 10-component canvas that emphasizes customer-centricity and job-based thinking.

## Building Your Business Model Canvas

Use the following prompts to systematically work through each component of the Business Model Canvas. These prompts will help you think critically about your business model and identify opportunities for innovation.

**Important:** As you complete each prompt, save the output to a file called `business-model-canvas.md` in your project directory. Each section should be appended to this file in order. By the end of this process, you'll have a complete, well-formatted business model canvas document that you can reference and use to create presentations.

The prompts are organized into four phases that follow the natural logic of business model development:

- **Phase 1: Customer Focus** - Understanding who you serve and what value you provide
- **Phase 2: Infrastructure** - Determining what you need to deliver that value
- **Phase 3: Financial Viability** - Understanding your cost structure
- **Phase 4: Synthesis** - Validating and visualizing your complete business model

```markdown
# Create Business Model Canvas Presentation Slide

I need you to create a professional Business Model Canvas presentation slide using the pptx skill.

**Context:** I have completed a comprehensive business model analysis with detailed information in the file `business-model-canvas.md`.

**Your Task:**

1. Read the entire `business-model-canvas.md` file to understand my complete business model
2. Extract and synthesize the KEY insights from each of the ten business model components:
   - Customer Segments
   - Jobs-To-Be-Done
   - Customer Value Proposition (CVP)
   - Channels
   - Customer Relationships
   - Revenue Streams
   - Key Resources
   - Key Activities
   - Key Partnerships
   - Cost Structure

3. Create a single PowerPoint slide using the pptx skill that presents a complete Business Model Canvas with:
   - A clear title indicating the business/product name
   - All ten building blocks arranged in the refined Business Model Canvas layout (with JTBD and CVP in the center)
   - Concise, bullet-point summaries for each block (3-5 bullets max per block)
   - Professional formatting with clear visual hierarchy
   - Appropriate use of color to distinguish different sections
   - Readable font sizes suitable for presentation

4. For each block, uplevel the detailed analysis from the markdown file into:
   - High-level strategic insights (not detailed explanations)
   - Concrete, specific points (not generic statements)
   - Action-oriented language where appropriate
   - Maximum clarity and brevity

**Design Guidelines:**
- Use the Business Model Canvas layout shown in images/business-model-canvas.png which splits the center into Jobs-To-Be-Done and Customer Value Proposition sections. If you can't access this file, use the Jeff Dyer refined BMC layout with 10 blocks.
- The center section should show JTBD (top) and CVP/Solution (bottom) as separate but connected blocks
- Ensure all text is legible and not overcrowded
- Use visual hierarchy to make the canvas easy to scan
- Consider using different background colors for the ten blocks to improve readability
- Include a footer with your company name or project name

**Output:** Create a professional PPTX file named `business-model-canvas.pptx` with one comprehensive 10-component Business Model Canvas slide.

Please read my `business-model-canvas.md` file now and create the presentation.

## Getting Started

Work through the prompts above in order, building your Business Model Canvas systematically. Each prompt builds on the previous ones, so keep your answers accessible to reference in later prompts.

**Tips for success:**

1. **Be specific:** Generic answers lead to generic business models. Include details about your specific business context.

2. **Iterate:** Your first answers won't be perfect. Use the AI to refine and improve each component.

3. **Stay customer-focused:** Always return to the question: "How does this create value for our customers?"

4. **Test assumptions:** For each component, identify what assumptions you're making and how you could validate them.

5. **Think holistically:** As you complete each section, consider how it affects the other components of your business model.

6. **Use the complete review:** Once you've filled in all components, use the final prompt to get a comprehensive analysis and identify areas for improvement.
