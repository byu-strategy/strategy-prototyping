        "## History of Product Management\n",
        "\n",
        "At its simplest, product management is about identifying customer needs, aligning them with business goals, and working with cross-functional teams to build products that succeed in the market. The person responsible is the Product Manager (PM), often called the \"CEO of the product.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Some people take issue with the “CEO” comparison, since product managers typically influence without formal authority and often don’t have many direct reports. Still, like a CEO, the skills of a product manager are broad and typically include:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Strategic thinking – setting vision, making trade-offs, and aligning with business goals\n",
        "-   Customer insight – understanding user needs and pain points\n",
        "-   Analytical ability – using data and critical thinking to guide decisions\n",
        "-   Technical & design fluency – collaborating effectively with engineers and designers\n",
        "-   Execution & organization – planning roadmaps, prioritizing, and delivering results\n",
        "-   Communication & leadership – influencing, storytelling, and managing stakeholders\n",
        "\n",
        "Products can be hardware or software, but since software dominates in volume, product management is often associated with software, even though many of the principles can apply equally well to hardware. Today, many hardware products come with a software component or integrated app, at times blurring the line between hardware and software. The focus of this course is software products that can be built with the assistance of AI.\n",
        "\n",
        "Product Management, as a formal discipline and job title, traces its roots to Hewlett-Packard in the 1940s, where it emerged as a distinct driver of innovation in technology. Yet the concept predates HP: a 1931 Procter & Gamble memo introduced the role of “Brand Men,” whose responsibilities closely foreshadowed what would later be recognized as Product Management.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Image source: Wikimedia Commons](images/brand-men.jpg)\n",

        "Early influences such as the \\[Scrum development process\\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum\\_(software_development))) and the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) reshaped how products are built, while initiatives like Google’s Associate Product Manager (APM) program and influential books helped standardize best practices. In recent years, PM has become one of the most sought-after careers, and today the field is entering a new era with the rise of the AI Product Manager.\n",

        "The personal computer revolution of the 1980s brought computing into offices and homes. The rise of the internet in the 1990s connected the world and created entirely new industries, from e-commerce to online media. In the 2000s, broadband (i.e. high-speed internet access) and cloud computing made software cheaper to build, scale, and distribute, while the launch of the iPhone in 2007 ushered in the smartphone era putting powerful applications directly into billions of people’s hands.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2011, Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) (known for its influential early investments in companies like Facebook, Airbnb, and Coinbase) famously observed that [*Software Is Eating the World*](https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/).\n",

        "AI now appears to be on track to “eat the world” again, this time at a much faster pace. The launch of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, marked a turning point, catalyzing mass adoption of generative AI and enabling the rise of the AI Product Manager.\n",
        "\n",
        "Marc now predicts that [*AI Will Save the World*](https://a16z.com/ai-will-save-the-world/), but this certainly won't happen automatically.

        "Over the past two decades, many companies adopted a *product trio* team structure for building software products. This structure brings together three complementary roles: the product manager, who defines the vision, strategy, and priorities; the designer, who ensures usability, aesthetics, and a seamless user experience; and one or more engineers, who turn ideas into functional, scalable solutions. By balancing business objectives, user needs, and technical feasibility, the trio has emerged as a proven way to foster cross-functional collaboration and accelerate product development.\n",
        "\n",
        "AI and the tools we will use in this course are having a major impact and disrupting what had become a stable organizational model. This is true because AI changes both the division of labor within the trio and the speed and scale at which individuals and teams can operate.\n",

        "\n",
        "With AI, a PM can quickly generate wireframes, mockups, or even working product demos without waiting on design or engineering support. Instead of handing off abstract requirements, they can test tangible ideas with users in days, not weeks. This doesn’t eliminate the need for designers and engineers, but it shifts when and how they are engaged. Designers can focus on higher-fidelity experience and brand expression, while engineers concentrate on scalability, integration, and technical soundness.\n",
        "\n",
        "It remains to be seen how this will fully play out, but early indications suggest that shifts in how PMs, designers, and engineers work together are real and lasting. With the right AI tools some ambitious individuals may be able to wear all three hats to varying degrees.\n",

        "![AI Product Management Learning Roadmap from Paweł Huryn](images/ai-pm-roadmap.jpeg)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Let's Build!\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Command Line\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to be a serious AI-Powered PM or AI Product PM, you need to get comfortable interacting with your computer via the [Terminal or command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).\n",
        "\n",
        "The command line, sometimes referred to as the CLI (Command Line Interface), is a text-based way to control your computer by typing instructions instead of using a mouse or touch interface. You access the command line through a program called a terminal, which displays a simple text-only window (typically black or white) with no buttons or icons.\n",
        "\n",
        "On macOS, this program is literally called Terminal. On Windows, you can use Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Git Bash to access a similar environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "When using Visual Studio Code, you can open a terminal within it, making it easy to run commands without switching between windows.\n",
        "\n",
        "When using the command line, instead of navigating through a graphical user interface (GUI) with windows and icons, you type commands directly into this terminal window and press Enter to execute them. The command line acts as your gateway to the underlying operating system, giving you direct access to files, programs, and system functions that might be buried deep within GUI menus or not available graphically at all.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach offers several advantages: greater precision in file operations, faster execution of repetitive tasks, access to powerful automation tools, and the ability to combine simple commands into complex workflows. Developers and data scientists rely on the command line because it's faster and more powerful for tasks like creating projects, installing software, running code, and automating workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "**ChatGPT and other LLM-powered generative AI tools have made learning the command line more important, not less.** The command line is where you unlock the real power of automation, enabling you to run scripts and streamline repetitive tasks. Many advanced system administration tasks, programming tools, and server management operations are primarily designed for command-line use, making terminal proficiency essential for developers and savvy product managers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, the command line is the native environment for the industry-leading approaches to AI-assisted coding such as Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI which we’ll be using throughout this class. By getting comfortable in the command line, you won’t just be learning an obscure developer skill; you’ll be stepping into the same environment where cutting-edge AI coding tools operate, giving you the ability to build, experiment, and ship AI products with confidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let's learn the command line by doing. Spend some time testing the following commands.\n",
        "\n",
        "These commands work seamlessly across **macOS** or **Windows** but there is a little bit of extra set up on Windows.\n",

Unlike traditional AI coding assistants that provide suggestions, Claude Code allows Claude to take full ownership of coding tasks, from analyzing requirements and planning implementation to writing, testing, and iterating on code across multiple files and directories. The tool is designed to integrate seamlessly into existing development workflows, allowing developers to describe what they want to build in natural language and have Claude execute the entire development process, including debugging, refactoring, and implementing best practices, while maintaining transparency through detailed logging and the ability for developers to review and approve changes at each step.\n",
