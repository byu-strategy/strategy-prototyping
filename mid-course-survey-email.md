Hi class,

We're near the midpoint of the semester and I'd love to hear how things are going. Please take 3-5 minutes to complete the anonymous mid-course feedback survey:

[Take the Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdb0CSWraZE2oJ4LnE0-OC-sJVfQcycqh81cMb6XW3VcO7zhw/viewform?usp=header)

Your honest feedback helps me adjust the course for the rest of the semester. This is completely anonymous so I won't know who said what.

To receive 5 extra credit points:

1. Complete the survey
2. Take a screenshot of the confirmation page
3. Submit the screenshot to LearningSuite by Tuesday, February 24 at 11:59 PM

The survey is anonymous, so the screenshot is the only way I can give you credit.

Thank you!

Scott
