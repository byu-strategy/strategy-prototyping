## The Lean Product Process

The Lean Product Process is a repeatable framework for systematically developing products that customers love developed by Dan Olsen.

It moves from deeply understanding customer needs (problem space) to iterating on solutions (solution space), always validating with customer feedback.

# Problem Space

## Target Customer

Identify the specific segment of people who will benefit most from your product.  

Not “everyone who might use it” — your *primary* audience you will optimize for first.

### User Personas

- Create 2–3 detailed fictional profiles representing your core customers.
- Include:
  - Demographics (age, job role, location)
  - Behaviors (habits, buying channels, product usage patterns)
  - Goals and motivations
  - Pain points and frustrations
- Use direct quotes from customer interviews when possible.


## Underserved Needs

Determine what matters most to your target customers and where current solutions fail them.

### Importance vs. Satisfaction

- Plot needs on a 2x2:

- **Importance** (how critical is it to the customer?)
- **Satisfaction** (how well do current solutions address it?)
- High importance + low satisfaction = **prime opportunity**.

### Jobs to Be Done

- Frame needs as *jobs* customers are trying to accomplish.
- Format:  
  - When I’m **[situation]**, I want to **[motivation]**, so I can **[desired outcome]**.
- Capture all:
  - **Emotional jobs** (how they want to feel)
  - **Social jobs** (how they want to be perceived)
  - **Functional jobs** (what they want to get done)

## Value Proposition

Craft a clear statement that answers:

1. **Who** the product is for  
2. **What** it does for them  
3. **Why** it’s better or different than alternatives  

Keep it short (1–2 sentences) and customer-oriented.

### Customer Journey Map

A customer journey map is a tool that shows the step-by-step experience a customer has with a product or experience.

It can be useful because it helps you:

- See the experience through the customer’s eyes.
- Spot pain points and improvement opportunities.
- Align your team around what really matters to customers.

It’s a tool for designing a smoother, more valuable customer experience.

# Solution Space

## Feature Set

List the features that directly address underserved needs.

- Rank features by **customer value** and **feasibility**.
- Avoid “feature creep” — every feature must trace back to a validated need.

## User Experience

Translate features into an intuitive, delightful, and friction-free customer journey.

### Principles of UX Design

- **Clarity** – Every screen communicates its purpose instantly.
- **Consistency** – Patterns, language, and visual design align across the product.
- **Feedback** – Users get immediate, understandable responses to actions.
- **Efficiency** – Reduce cognitive load and clicks for key tasks.
- **Empathy** – Design flows from the user’s point of view, not the internal org chart.

Dan Olsen’s iceberg reminds us that **great UX starts deep below the surface**.

- **Conceptual Design** → Drives **Clarity**: a solid mental model ensures screens make sense instantly.
- **Information Architecture** → Enables **Efficiency**: well-organized content reduces cognitive load.
- **Interaction Design** → Supports **Consistency** and **Feedback**: familiar patterns and responsive flows guide users.
- **Visual Design** → Reinforces **Empathy**: aesthetics reflect users’ needs and context.

A polished UI alone can’t deliver on these principles, they must be built into every layer of the iceberg.
