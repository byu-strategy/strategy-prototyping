## Content Overview

Welcome to *Creating Digital Products with AI: Strategy & Prototyping*. 

What should a product manager be able to do in the era of AI? This course offers a hands-on, forward-looking answer.

Students will explore foundational frameworks in product strategy, customer-centric design, and rapid iteration. Along the way, they’ll leverage both standard industry tools (i.e. GitHub, Jira, Figma) as well as modern AI tools (e.g. Lovable, Replit, Cursor, Windsurf) to ideate, prototype, and build real digital products.

AI is blurring the traditional boundaries between Product Management, Engineering, and Design. This course explores how product managers can use AI to enhance collaboration and accelerate execution.

Throughout the course, students will learn how AI is reshaping every stage of the product lifecycle, from identifying customer needs and defining MVPs to accelerating prototyping, testing, and user feedback. By the end of the semester, students will have developed and validated an AI-enabled product, preparing them to excel in a world where successful product management requires both strategic insight and hands-on experimentation with emerging technologies.

There are no formal prerequisites for the course, but students should have an interest in going deep on a technical level and will learn to code with help from AI.
