        "\"A series of tubes\" is a phrase coined originally as an analogy by then-United States Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) to describe the Internet in the context of opposing network neutrality.\\[1\\] On June 28, 2006, he used this metaphor to criticize a proposed amendment to a committee bill. The amendment would have prohibited Internet Access providers such as AT&T, Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and Verizon Communications from charging fees to give some companies' data a higher priority in relation to other traffic.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**What is the internet, really???**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Internet is a global system of interconnected computers and devices that communicate using standardized protocols—primarily the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)—to share information and services. These devices form a vast network-of-networks, exchanging data over physical infrastructure such as fiber-optic cables, satellites, and wireless technologies.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Internet is a decentralized system where independently operated networks agree to exchange data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The internet is a global network of devices connected via cables (fiber, copper, etc.), satellites, or wireless systems. Devices that connect to the internet communicate with each other by exchanging data using various sets of rules called protocols. Each protocol governs how a specific type of communication is carried out. For example, sending an email uses the SMTP protocol, while loading a webpage in your browser typically uses HTTPS.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, when you open Gmail in your browser and send an email, multiple protocols are at work: HTTPS is used to load the Gmail web interface and securely interact with it, while SMTP is used behind the scenes to transmit the email to the recipient’s mail server.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each protocol has it's own rules simliar to the grammar rules of a language (e.g. verb tense, sentence structure).\n",
        "\n",
        "Just as using proper grammar helps people understand each other clearly and effectively, the rules of a given protocol ensure that devices can reliably exchange a given type of data (e.g. email).\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most important protocols on the modern internet is HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), which smartphones and laptops use—typically through web browsers—to securely interact with websites.\n",
        "\n",
        "We dive into some of the rules later in this chapter.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, we need a better understanding for the kinds of devices that get connected to the Internet. When we say device, we mean any of the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Client devices – such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, and desktop computers that request data or services from servers.\n",
        "-   Servers – computers (physical or virtual) that host websites, applications, files, or other data, and respond to client requests.\n",
        "-   Routers and switches – networking hardware that directs traffic across the internet and within local networks.\n",
        "-   Internet of Things (IoT) devices – smart thermostats, cameras, watches, appliances, and other gadgets that send and receive data.\n",
        "-   Data center infrastructure – large-scale systems including virtual machines and containerized environments that power cloud services.\n",
        "-   Edge devices – equipment like content delivery nodes or local caching servers that bring data closer to users for faster access.\n",

        "DNS (Domain Name System) is the internet's phonebook. Imagine a look-up table where every text URL is matched to the the IP address (a number that uniquely identifies the device or server).\n",
        "\n",
        "You typed www.example.com. Your device asks a DNS server: \"What is the IP address of this domain?\" The DNS server replies with something like: 93.184.216.34. Now your computer knows where to send the request.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 2: HTTP/HTTPS Request Now that you know the server's address:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Your browser sends an HTTP (or HTTPS) request to the IP address. This request says: \"Please send me the web page for / (the homepage) of www.example.com.\" If it's HTTPS, the request is encrypted, so no one in between can read it.\n",
        "\n",
        "HTTP(S) stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol (Secure). A \"protocol\" is simply a formal set of rules for how computers communicate. Think of it like a shared language or etiquette for machines. These rules define how a client (like your browser) and a server (like example.com) exchange requests and responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 3: Client-Server Architecture**\n",
        "\n",
        "Your device (the client) made the request. The server (at 93.184.216.34) receives it, processes it, and sends back the necessary files — HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc. You can think of this like a waiter (client) asking the kitchen (server) for your order (website) and bringing it back to your table (browser).\n",

        "-   **Implement proper access controls** — not everyone needs admin API keys\n",
        "-   **Log carefully** — never log API keys, passwords, or sensitive user data\n",
