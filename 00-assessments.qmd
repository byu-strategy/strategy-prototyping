## Quizzes

In-class quizzes assess your understanding of the assigned reading. Each quiz is worth 5 points (1% of your grade).

Quizzes occur at the beginning of class on the dates shown in the [schedule](00-schedule.qmd). They cover the chapter assigned for that week.

::: {.callout-note title="Why We Do Quizzes"}
Research shows that writing down what you've just learned helps your brain remember it better. Psychologists call this the "testing effect" or "retrieval practice": when you pull ideas out of your head and put them into words, you strengthen your memory far more than by just rereading or listening.

## Sprints

Sprints are your primary way to demonstrate progress throughout the semester. Each sprint builds on the previous one, and your portfolio is the submission point for all sprint work.

**Portfolio:** You'll use the same portfolio URL all semester. TAs will check your portfolio at each sprint deadline.

**Videos:** All sprint submissions require a 2-minute Loom video walking through your deliverables.

**Portfolio Template:** [github.com/byu-strategy/product-management-portfolio](https://github.com/byu-strategy/product-management-portfolio)

## Peer Assignments

Peer assignments teach you to give and receive constructive feedback, a critical professional skill. You'll be randomly paired with different classmates for each assignment.

---

### Peer Code Review

**Week 8-9 | 50 points | Due: Thu, Feb 26**

**Goal:** Apply code analysis skills to a peer's codebase and provide constructive feedback.

**Process:**

1. You'll be assigned a partner (different from your product testing partner)
2. Your partner shares their GitHub repo with you
3. You use Claude Code to analyze their codebase
4. You write a professional code review
5. You actually run and test their app

**Deliverables:**

**Part 1: AI-Assisted Analysis**

Run the following prompts in Claude Code on your peer's repo and save the outputs:

```markdown
Prompt 1: "Analyze this project structure. List all directories and their purposes,
identify frontend vs backend files, and count total lines of code.
Save as peer-review-structure.md"

Prompt 2: "Trace the main user flow from UI to database.
What happens when a user performs the core action?
Save as peer-review-dataflow.md"

Prompt 3: "Identify the architecture pattern, code organization,
and any potential security concerns or code smells.
Save as peer-review-architecture.md"
```

**Part 2: Written Review**

Write a 1-2 page review covering:

- **Architecture observations:** What patterns did you notice? How is the code organized?
- **Code quality:** What's done well? What could be cleaner?
- **Security considerations:** Any obvious vulnerabilities?
- **3 specific suggestions:** Actionable improvements with rationale

**Part 3: Kick the Tires**

- Sign up and use the app as a real user
- Document: Did it work? What broke? What was confusing?

**Turn in:**

- The 3 AI-generated markdown files
- Your written review (PDF or markdown)
- Brief notes from your testing session

**Grading Rubric (50 points)**

| Category | Points |
|----------|--------|
| AI analysis files complete and thorough | 15 |
| Written review professional and constructive | 20 |
| Testing notes with specific observations | 10 |
| Tone is helpful, not harsh | 5 |

::: {.callout-tip title="Code Review Mindset"}
Your goal is to help your peer improve, not to criticize. Frame feedback as "Have you considered..." or "One thing that might help..." Great code reviewers make others want to work with them.

### Peer Product Testing

**Week 12-13 | 50 points | Due: Thu, Apr 2**

**Goal:** Be a real test user for a peer's product and provide actionable UX feedback.

**Process:**

1. You'll be assigned a different partner than code review
2. You become an actual user of their product
3. You sign up, use core features, and try to break things
4. You document your experience and provide feedback

**Deliverables:**

**Part 1: Test Session Documentation**

Use the product for at least 20-30 minutes and document:

- **First impressions (30 seconds):** What did you think when you first landed on the app?
- **Signup/onboarding:** Was it smooth? Confusing? How long did it take?
- **Core task completion:** Try to complete the main action(s). Did it work?
- **Bugs found:** Screenshots + steps to reproduce
- **Confusing moments:** Where did you get stuck or have to think?
- **What worked well:** What was intuitive or delightful?

**Part 2: Feedback Summary**

Write up:

- 3 things that worked well (be specific)
- 3 prioritized improvement suggestions (most impactful first)
- Overall impression: Would you use this? Would you pay for it? Why or why not?

**Part 3: Video Walkthrough (Optional but encouraged)**

- 2-3 min Loom showing your testing session
- Narrate your thoughts as you use the app

**Turn in:**

- Test session documentation
- Feedback summary
- Video link (if recorded)

**Grading Rubric (50 points)**

| Category | Points |
|----------|--------|
| Thorough test documentation with specifics | 20 |
| Constructive feedback summary | 20 |
| Evidence of genuine engagement (not surface-level) | 10 |

::: {.callout-tip title="Testing Mindset"}
Your job is to help your peer see their product through fresh eyes. Be honest but kind. The best feedback is specific ("The button on the checkout page didn't respond when I clicked it") not vague ("The checkout was buggy").
