## Exams

### Pre-Course Knowledge Check

The pre-course knowledge check is a 50 question multiple-choice exam. It does not count towards your grade but is required for you to complete. The purpose of the knowledge check is to understand your baseline level knowledge coming into the class.

Complete the exam on LearningSuite.

Do not use AI or any outside resources while completing the exam. Doing so would defeat its purpose and failed to give an accurate signal on base level knowledge.

The final exam will be very similar in content and structure and will be completed in the testing center.

Hence, comparing your final exam score to your score on the pre-course knowledge check will give you a good sense for what you have learned in the course. 

### Final Exam

## Quizzes

All quizzes are given during class and will consist of five questions drawn from the associated readings and displayed on the projector.
