## Quizzes

In-class quizzes assess your understanding of the assigned reading. Each quiz is worth 5 points (1% of your grade).

Quizzes occur at the beginning of class on the dates shown in the [schedule](00-schedule.qmd). They cover the chapter assigned for that week.

::: {.callout-note title="Why We Do Quizzes"}
Research shows that writing down what you've just learned helps your brain remember it better. Psychologists call this the "testing effect" or "retrieval practice": when you pull ideas out of your head and put them into words, you strengthen your memory far more than by just rereading or listening.

## Sprints

Sprints are your primary way to demonstrate progress throughout the semester. Each sprint builds on the previous one, and your portfolio is the submission point for all sprint work.

**Portfolio:** You'll use the same portfolio URL all semester. TAs will check your portfolio at each sprint deadline.

**Videos:** All sprint submissions require a 2-minute Loom video walking through your deliverables.

**Portfolio Template:** [github.com/byu-strategy/product-management-portfolio](https://github.com/byu-strategy/product-management-portfolio)

### Sprint 1: Ship & Showcase {#sprint-1-ship-showcase}

**50 points | Due: Thu, Jan 29**

**Overview**

The purpose of this homework assignment is to help you create a public facing portfolio containing your work that you can use to share with potential employers and others.

The deliverables for this homework are:

1. A URL pointing to your personal portfolio published on the internet via GitHub Pages (see [**template**](https://sdmurff.github.io/student-test/))
2. A 2-minute Loom video walking through your portfolio

**Set-up**

1) Create a new repo from the following template on GitHub: [https://github.com/byu-strategy/product-management-portfolio](https://github.com/byu-strategy/product-management-portfolio). Call the repo "portfolio".

![](images/new-repo-template.jpg)

2) After creating the repo, go to `Settings -> Pages -> Deploy from a branch`, and select `GitHub Actions`

![](images/github-actions-deploy.jpg)

3) Start VS Code and then `Open -> Open Folder` to the folder you want to save your portfolio files in. Then open a Terminal within VS Code.

4) Copy/paste the URL of your new repo and run the following command from the terminal. Your URL should have the following structure: https://github.com/[your github username]/portfolio

```{python eval=false}
git clone https://github.com/[your github username]/portfolio.git
```

Make sure to add `.git` to the end of the URL and update your user name before running the command.

5) Then use the terminal to navigate into the newly cloned git repo (folder)

```{python eval=false}
cd portfolio
```

6) You should now see all of the files from the repo in your left hand window pane within VS Code. These are the source files behind the [**template**](https://sdmurff.github.io/student-test/).

7) To complete the homework, you will edit and personalize the template. Once you are done editing, save all of the files and run the following git commands to publish your portfolio:

```{python eval=false}
git add .
git commit -m "write a short message describing your changes"
git push
```

Once you have pushed your changes, within about one minute, your website portfolio will be live at this URL: https://[your github username].github.io/portfolio/

**Remember to update your user name in the URL.**

You can preview what your portfolio looks like at any point by running this command from the terminal:

```{python eval=false}
quarto preview
```

For this to work, you will need to install `quarto`. Get Claude code to help you install it.

**Requirements**

You should make at least the following changes to the source files of your portfolio.

1) Add a personal photo (I recommend using your LinkedIn photo for a consistent online presence)
2) Update and personalize the Home page (index.qmd)
3) Update and personalize the About page (about.qmd)
4) Update and personalize the project-1.qmd file to accurately reflect the application you built. **The two buttons linking to your GitHub source code and deployed Vercel app are required and will be verified during grading.**
5) Use AI or another tool of your choice to create a [favicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) and update the image reference in the `.yml`. You could use an icon or just your initial(s).
6) Create a "Problems I'm Exploring" page on your portfolio with 5 problems you personally experience. For each problem:
   - Write a professional, public-facing description
   - Explain why this problem matters to you
   - Frame it as something worth solving (not just a complaint)
7) Choose one other person to show your portfolio to and describe to them what you built. Take a couple minutes to explain to them the tools and skills you are learning.

Although not required for this assignment, you should feel free to make further enhancements and personalizations to your portfolio. You will continue to build on this portfolio throughout the course so it should be something you invest significant effort in as it can be a valuable tool for you in the future to showcase your skills.

**Turn in:**

Submit a PDF or Word Doc containing:

- URL to your live portfolio
- URL to your Loom video walkthrough

**Video Requirements:**

Your 2-minute Loom video should cover:

1. **Portfolio walkthrough** - Walk through your portfolio showing your About page, prototype project, and Problems I'm Exploring page
2. **What you learned** - Briefly explain one new tool or skill you learned while building this
3. **Show & tell reflection** - Share who you showed your portfolio to (name and relationship), and describe their reaction:
   - What questions did they ask?
   - What was their overall impression?
   - Did anything surprise you about their feedback?

**Grading Rubric (50 points)**

| Category | Points | Expectations |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| **Portfolio Deployed & Accessible** | 10 | Site is live at GitHub Pages URL, all pages load without errors, navigation works |
| **About Section** | 5 | Personal photo included, compelling personal story, professional tone, no placeholder text |
| **Prototype Project** | 15 | Project page complete with description, working links to both deployed Vercel app AND GitHub repo |
| **Problems I'm Exploring** | 10 | 5 distinct problems listed, each professionally framed with clear description of why it matters |
| **Client Ready Polish** | 5 | No broken links, no typos, consistent formatting, would confidently show to an employer |
| **Loom Video Walkthrough** | 5 | 2-min video covering portfolio walkthrough, what you learned, and show & tell reflection |

**What "Client Ready" Means:**

Your portfolio should be something you could show to a prospective employer with confidence. This means:

- All hyperlinks work
- No spelling or grammar errors
- No placeholder or template text remaining
- Images load properly
- Consistent visual styling
- Professional tone throughout

Points will be deducted for issues that detract from a professional presentation.

### Sprint 2: Validate & Commit

**50 points | Due: Tue, Feb 17, 11:59pm**

**Goal:** Identify and validate a problem worth solving and then commit to building it out for the rest of the semester.

| Deliverable | Points |
|---|--:|
| Problem Discovery Worksheet (2 problems scored) | 10 |
| AI Interview (shared conversation URL) | 10 |
| One recorded customer interview + AI transcript analysis | 10 |
| JTBD + Value Proposition + ICP summary | 10 |
| Loom reflection video (2 min) | 10 |
| **Total** | **50** |

**What you turn in:** A single Google Doc using the [Sprint 2 Submission Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AnK5Jo8JtcRR6mllhXQmAHFrnufvclO8Qe3z7Wrf2M8/copy). Make a copy now and fill it in as you work through each part below.

#### The Problem Discovery Worksheet

This sprint uses the **[Problem Discovery Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_4JSjwVJuFU-D2lYZnL91c6GHApj7lYkCJ9jQ5In_GM/copy)** — a structured framework for exploring and evaluating problems worth solving. Click the link to make your own copy.

The worksheet is grounded in **Self-Determination Theory** (Deci & Ryan) which cleanly parallels the core tenets of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and identifies three universal human needs:

| Human Need | Gospel Framing | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| **Autonomy** | Agency | Control over your life and choices |
| **Competence** | Becoming | Growth, mastery, becoming more capable |
| **Relatedness** | Connection | Meaningful relationships with others |

The worksheet organizes life into **15 domains** (plus 6 work sub-domains) ordered from inner to outer: starting with Body, Mind, and Spirit, then moving through your environment, resources, growth, relationships, and work. Each row includes **granular activities** to prompt specific recall of where frustration or delight occurs.

::: {.callout-tip title="Frustration AND Delight"}
Problems aren't only about pain. Both **frustration** (pain to relieve) and **delight** (joy to amplify) are valid signals. A frustration points to a pain reliever product. A delight points to a gain creator product. The worksheet captures both.
:::

#### Problem Discovery Framework

Expand the box below and copy-paste the framework into your AI conversation in Part 2. Review the full [Problem Discovery Framework](94-problem-discovery-framework.qmd) reference page.

#### Part 1: Describe 3 Problems

**Start with your "unfair" advantages.** Before scanning every domain, pause and ask: *Where do I have unusual insight that most people don't?* Maybe you grew up on a cattle ranch, served a mission in rural Southeast Asia, worked night shifts at a fulfillment center, or spent years managing your family's small business. Those experiences give you a front-row seat to problems that people outside that world would never think to solve and that's exactly the kind of edge that can make for a great product discovery. List 2-3 domains where you have this kind of special access, and start there.

If nothing jumps out at you, then broaden your thinking. Scan the worksheet's remaining life domains. For each domain, reflect on the example **activities** listed and ask yourself:

- **Frustration:** What made me or someone close to me angry, stuck, or anxious recently?
- **Delight:** What do I love doing that could be even better?

Choose **3 problems** you'd want to explore further. These can be any mix of problems from Sprint 1 or new ideas. For each row, fill in the **narrative fields only**, no scores yet:

- **Who** — A real person's name (not a persona, you'll create that at the end)
- **Frustration / Delight** — What they experience
- **Customer's Job to be Done** — "I'm trying to [verb] so I can [outcome]"
- **Value Proposition, i.e. how you would do the customer's job** — "We help [who] [do what] by [how]"

Do this on your own before moving to Part 2. The goal is to articulate each problem in your own words first. Complete your [Problem Discovery Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_4JSjwVJuFU-D2lYZnL91c6GHApj7lYkCJ9jQ5In_GM/copy) with 3 problems described (narrative fields above filled in).

#### Part 2: AI-Assisted Scoring & Evaluation

Pick the most compelling **2 problems** from Part 1 and use AI as described below for a structured evaluation. You must use **Claude.ai, ChatGPT, or Gemini** so you can share a link to the conversation.

**How to start:** Copy the prompt below into your AI conversation and update with your 2 problem descriptions.

```
I'm exploring 2 problems for a product I want to build. Here is
the Problem Discovery Framework my course uses:

PROBLEM DISCOVERY FRAMEWORK

OPPORTUNITY SIGNALS
- Frustration → Pain Reliever: Reduce friction, remove obstacles, solve problems
- Delight → Gain Creator: Amplify joy, create more of what works, enhance experiences

OPPORTUNITY SCORE (1-5 scales)

Frequency:      1=Rarely, 2=Yearly, 3=Monthly, 4=Weekly, 5=Daily
Intensity (F):  1=Shrug, 2=Minor annoyance, 3=Annoying, 4=Frustrating, 5=I hate this
Intensity (D):  1=Meh, 2=Mildly pleasant, 3=Enjoyable, 4=Love it, 5=Can't live without
Willingness:    1=Wouldn't pay, 2=Unlikely, 3=Might pay, 4=Probably would, 5=Already paying
Market Size:    1=Just me, 2=Small niche, 3=Moderate group, 4=Large segment, 5=Widespread

CONVICTION SCORE (0/1 checkboxes, sum of 4)
- Personal Pain: You live this problem yourself
- Close Relationship: Someone you love experiences this
- Moral Calling: You believe it's wrong that this problem exists
- Unique Insight or Skills: You see something others don't

Sum 0-1 = Low (reconsider) | 2 = Moderate (explore further) | 3-4 = High (strong conviction)

TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY (0/1 checkboxes, sum of 3)
- Data/API Access: I can get the data or API access I need
- Technology Readiness: Tech is good enough to deliver a great experience
- No Hardware or Regulatory Blockers: No unavailable hardware or regulatory approval needed

Sum 3 = Clear path | 1-2 = Caution (have a plan) | 0 = Blocked (reconsider)

GOSPEL FRAMEWORK (directional checks)
- Expands Agency: Does my value proposition expand what users can do and choose?
- Supports Becoming: Does my value proposition help users genuinely grow?
- Deepens Connection: Does my value proposition strengthen real relationships?

Not every product needs all three. The question is directional: for the needs
you DO touch, are you on the right side?

Here are my 2 problems:

1. [Paste your Who, Frustration/Delight, JTBD, and Value Prop]
2. [Paste your Who, Frustration/Delight, JTBD, and Value Prop]

Take them one at a time. For each problem, walk me through the scoring
dimensions in the framework: Opportunity (Frequency, Intensity,
Willingness to Pay, Market Size), Conviction, Feasibility, and Mission
Fit. This is an interview — ask me questions about my experience, then
YOU assign scores based on my answers and your own knowledge. Don't ask
me to pick scores. Push back where my thinking seems shallow. Always
number your questions so I can respond easily, and never ask more than
3 questions at a time.

After we've scored both, give me a side-by-side scorecard table
comparing every dimension across the 2 problems. Then ask me: "All
things considered, which of these ideas would you be most excited to
build for the rest of the semester?"
```

The AI will interview you about each problem and help you assign initial scores across every dimension in the framework. After this conversation, update your worksheet with the final scores for both problems.

Reflect on your AI interview and make a decision on which product to build. The answer doesn't necessarily need to be the idea with the highest score. For our class, the primary concern is finding something you are excited to build, not necessarily something that will turn into a real profit-making product (although that's great if it happens).

**Deliverable:** Your shared conversation URL (use the share/link feature in your chosen AI tool) + completed scores on the worksheet. Add both to your submission template.

#### Part 3: One Customer Interview (Recorded)

Conduct at least one 5-minute interview via Loom with a real person who experiences your problem.

**Interview tips (The Mom Test):** Ask about **past behavior**, not hypotheticals. Don't pitch your idea. Listen for specifics, emotion, and workarounds.

Good questions:

- "Tell me about the last time you [activity from worksheet]..."
- "What did you do about it?"
- "What was the hardest part?"
- "How are you dealing with it now?"
- "How much time/money does this cost you?"

Bad questions:

- "Would you use an app that..."
- "Do you think this is a good idea?"

After recording, paste or upload the Loom transcript into an AI tool (Claude, Claude Code, ChatGPT, or Gemini) and have it help you extract **key quotes, patterns, and surprises** from the interview.

Add a few sentences of your personal reflections on what you learned if it reinforces or causes you to pause about your idea.

**Deliverable:** Add your Loom recording URL and AI-assisted transcript analysis (key quotes, patterns, surprises, and your reflections) to your submission template.

#### Part 4: Summarize & Commit

Based on everything you've learned from the worksheet, AI interview, and customer interview, write up your final:

- **Job to be Done** — "I'm trying to [action] so I can [outcome]"
- **Value Proposition** — "We help [who] [do what] by [how]"
- **Ideal Customer Profile** — A detailed portrait of who you're building for. You can use the template below to have AI help you document the persona.

**Ideal Customer Profile should include:**

*Who they are:*

- Name (make one up to humanize them)
- Demographics (age, role, situation)
- Context (when/where do they experience this problem?)

*Their problem:*

- Goals (what are they trying to accomplish?)
- Frustrations or delights (what drives them?)
- Current solutions (what do they do today?)

*Why it matters (synthesis from your framework scores):*

- Frequency — How often do they experience this?
- Intensity — How strong is the frustration or delight?
- Willingness to Pay — Evidence they'd pay to solve this

*Market size:*

- How many people like this exist?
- Where do they congregate? (communities, platforms, locations)
- How would you reach them?

**Deliverable:** Write your JTBD + Value Proposition + Ideal Customer Profile directly in your submission template.

#### Part 5: Loom Reflection Video

Record a 2-minute Loom video reflecting on your Sprint 2 journey. In your video, address:

- Which problem you chose and why
- Walk through the worksheet scores you gave it
- What you learned from the AI interview and customer interview
- Why you're excited about solving this problem

**Deliverable:** Add your Loom video URL to your submission template.

#### Turn In

Make a copy of the **[Sprint 2 Submission Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AnK5Jo8JtcRR6mllhXQmAHFrnufvclO8Qe3z7Wrf2M8/copy)** and fill in all sections. Your worksheet link, AI interview link, customer interview, transcript analysis, JTBD/Value Prop/ICP, and reflection video all go in this single document.

**Submit:** Your completed Google Doc URL.

#### Grading Rubric (50 points)

| Category | Points |
|----------|--------|
| Problem Discovery Worksheet (2 problems scored with complete fields) | 10 |
| AI Interview (shared conversation URL showing deep, challenging dialogue) | 10 |
| Customer Interview (Loom recording + AI-assisted transcript analysis with your reflections) | 10 |
| JTBD + Value Proposition + Ideal Customer Profile (clear, specific, grounded in your research) | 10 |
| Loom reflection video (2 min, covers problem choice, scores, learnings, and excitement) | 10 |

### Sprint 3: Product MVP

**50 points | Assigned: Tue, Feb 24 | Due: Tue, Mar 10**

**Goal:** Build the core feature that delivers your value proposition, test it with real users, and decide on your platform strategy.

| Deliverable | Points |
|---|--:|
| Product Spec Documents (AI-assisted) | 10 |
| Core feature functional with data persistence | 15 |
| 3 user tests with feedback synthesis | 15 |
| Platform strategy decision documented | 5 |
| Loom reflection video (2 min) | 5 |
| **Total** | **50** |

**What you turn in:** A single Google Doc link on LearningSuite using the [Sprint 3 Submission Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14DCFSVRxwG4djSrESHcmspmy3z37scMhkmGpJSkGyPc/copy). Your Google Doc collects all links (Updated Portfolio, GitHub, Vercel, Loom recordings) and written deliverables in one place.

#### Part 1: Product Spec Documents (AI-Assisted)

Your product spec documents live in your codebase and tell both you and Claude Code what you're building. The key documents are:

1. **CLAUDE.md** — Your project's instruction file. This should contain your product overview, target user, value proposition, tech stack, and key decisions. Claude Code reads this every time it starts, so keeping it current means better AI assistance.
2. **Spec documents** — Detailed requirements, user stories, and feature specs. These can live in a `specs/` or `docs/` folder in your repo, or wherever makes sense for your project.

**What your spec documents might cover (not all required, use what makes sense for your app, if you don't know, ask Claude):**

| Section | Where It Lives | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Product overview, JTBD, value prop, ICP | `CLAUDE.md` | Quick context for you and Claude Code |
| User stories with acceptance criteria | Spec doc(s) | What to build, in detail |
| Functional requirements | Spec doc(s) | What the MVP must do |
| Out of scope | Spec doc(s) or `CLAUDE.md` | What you're explicitly NOT building |
| Success metrics | Spec doc(s) | How you'll know it's working |
| Database Schema | Spec doc(s) or `CLAUDE.md` | How data is persisted |

**How to start:** Use AI to help you generate appropriate documents for your product. You may copy the prompt below to get started. Or chart your own path from scratch.

```
I'm building a product and need spec documents. Here's my context:

- Job to be Done: [paste your JTBD from Sprint 2]
- Value Proposition: [paste your Value Prop from Sprint 2]
- Ideal Customer Profile: [paste your ICP summary from Sprint 2]

Generate:

1. A CLAUDE.md I can add to my project with: product
   overview, target user, value proposition, and tech stack

2. A product spec document with:
   - 5 user stories in "As a [user], I want [goal] so that
     [benefit]" format, each with acceptance criteria
   - Functional requirements — what must the MVP do?
   - Success metrics — how will we know it's working?
   - Out of scope — what we are explicitly NOT building

For the user stories, prioritize using the MoSCoW method:
- Must have: MVP fails without this
- Should have: Important but MVP works without it
- Could have: Nice if time permits
- Won't have: Explicitly out of scope for now

Be ruthless about scope. This is an MVP. Focus on the ONE core
action users must be able to complete.
```

After generating, review carefully. Ask yourself:

- Does the "Must have" list truly contain only what's essential?
- Could you cut one more user story and still deliver value?
- Are the success metrics things you can actually measure?
- Does your CLAUDE.md give Claude Code enough context to help you build?

**Deliverable:** GitHub URLs to your CLAUDE.md and spec documents committed to your repo. Share your report with sdmurff, nmccaul, and twall03 if private.

#### Part 2: Build Your Core Feature

This is the heart of Sprint 3. Your app should do the one thing that delivers your value proposition. Remember: an MVP isn't a complete product with every layer finished. It's a thin slice through all the layers — functional, reliable, usable, and even a little delightful — for your core action only.

![Image source: The Lean Product Playbook by Dan Olsen](images/mvp.png)

**Requirements:**

- **Core action works end-to-end**: A user can complete the main task your product promises
- **Data persistence**: User data is saved to Supabase (not just local state)
- **Authentication**: Users can sign up/log in and see only their own data (RLS enabled)
- **Deployed**: Your app is live at a public URL (e.g. Vercel)

**Tips for building with Claude Code:**

Give Claude Code your spec documents as context. A good prompt:

```
In @file_name.md, build the core feature described in the "Must have" user stories.
I will eventually use Supabase for the database and auth. Help me design the database schema as well. The app will be deployed to Vercel.
```

Break the work into pieces. Don't ask Claude Code to build everything at once. This is bit of trial an error on how much Claude can bite off at one time. Experiment to get a feel for it. If you burn through your Claude tokens, try switching over to the native Antigavity agent. Tag your Claude.md and spec files and ask the agent to pick up where Claude left off. 


**What "functional" means for grading:**

- A TA can sign up, complete the core action, and see their data persist
- No placeholder data or hardcoded content, it works with real user input
- Basic error states are handled (empty states, failed saves)

**Deliverable:** Working app at a public URL (Vercel) with core feature functional. Add your Vercel link, and your GitHub repo link to your portfolio and submission. If you GitHub repo is private, go to setting and share it with the TAs: 

#### Part 3: Conduct 3 User Tests

Now that your core feature works, watch real people try to use it. For deeper background, see [Chapter 6](06-testing-with-users.qmd).

**Why this matters:** You built this thing. You know exactly where every button is and what every label means. Your users don't. This is the **curse of knowledge** — once you know something, it's nearly impossible to imagine not knowing it. The only cure is watching people who don't know.

Usability testing is not a demo. It's not a survey. It's observing real users attempt real tasks while you stay quiet and take notes.

**Who to test with:** People who match your Ideal Customer Profile from Sprint 2.

**Test script structure:**

Use this structure for each ~10 minute session:

```
INTRO (1 minute)
"Thanks for helping me test this. I'm testing the product,
not you — there are no wrong answers. Please think out loud
as you go. I'll mostly stay quiet and take notes."

TASK (5-7 minutes)
"Imagine you want to [core action]. Go ahead and try."
[Stay quiet. Observe. Take notes.]

FOLLOW-UP (2-3 minutes)
"What was that experience like?"
"What was most confusing?"
"What would you change?"
```

**During the session:**

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Stay silent while they work | Help them unless completely stuck |
| Let them struggle (painful but necessary) | Explain why something works that way |
| Note where they pause, click wrong things, hesitate | Defend your design decisions |
| Ask "What are you thinking?" if they go quiet | Lead with "Did you see the button in the corner?" |
| Take notes on behavior, not just outcomes | Ask "Do you like it?" (opinions aren't data) |

**How to run each test:**

1. **Share your live URL** — don't demo it for them, let them find their way
2. **Give them a task** — "Imagine you want to [core action]. Go ahead and try."
3. **Stay quiet** — this is the hard part. Don't help. Don't explain. Just watch and take notes.
4. **Record the session** — use Loom to capture screen + audio (get their permission)
5. **Ask follow-up questions** after they finish

**Severity levels** — use these to classify issues you find:

| Severity | Definition | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Critical** | User cannot complete the core task | Can't sign up, main action broken |
| **Major** | Task is possible but difficult | Takes 5 minutes to find the main feature |
| **Minor** | Annoying but doesn't block anything | Confusing label, awkward layout |

**Use this observation template for each test:**

```
Test #: ___
Tester name: ___
Why is this person a good tester? ___
Date: ___

Task given: ___

OBSERVATIONS:
- Could they complete the core task? (Yes / No / Partially)
- Time to complete: ___
- Where did they get stuck?
- Where did they click wrong things or hesitate?
- What did they say out loud?
- Facial expressions / body language:

FOLLOW-UP RESPONSES:
- What was confusing?
- What would they change?
- Would they use this again?

SEVERITY OF ISSUES FOUND:
- Critical (can't complete core task):
- Major (difficult but possible):
- Minor (annoying but not blocking):
```

**After all 3 tests, synthesize your findings.** You can paste your notes (and loom transcript) into AI to help:

```
Here are my usability test notes from 3 sessions testing my product:

[Paste all 3 observation notes]

Synthesize these into:
1. A summary paragraph of overall findings
2. Issues found, grouped by severity (critical, major, minor)
3. Patterns: what did multiple testers experience?
4. Key quotes from testers that illustrate important findings
5. Top 3 prioritized changes I should make, with rationale
```

**Deliverable:** Your 3 test observation notes + AI-assisted synthesis. Include Loom recording URLs for each session. Add a polished user feedback summary to your portfolio.

#### Part 4: Platform Strategy Decision

Document your platform strategy decision. For deeper background, see [Chapter 7](07-platform-strategy.qmd).

**The Platform Decision Framework** — start by answering these questions honestly:

| Question | If Yes → | If No → |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Do users need this away from a computer? | Consider mobile | Web is fine |
| Does it need device hardware (camera, GPS, sensors)? | Consider mobile | Web is fine |
| Is your core user flow < 30 seconds? | Mobile-friendly matters | Desktop-first okay |
| Do competitors have apps? | Understand why | May not need one |
| Will users install another app? | Maybe mobile | Probably web |

**The platform spectrum** — you don't have to choose between "web only" and "native app." There's a progression:

| Approach | Effort | Native Feel | App Store? | Best For |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Responsive Web** | Low | Low | No | Most B2B, productivity, content apps |
| **PWA** | Medium | Medium | Limited | Internal tools, B2B, content-heavy apps |
| **Capacitor** | Medium | Medium-High | Yes | Consumer apps needing store presence |
| **React Native** | High | High | Yes | Performance-critical consumer apps |
| **Native (Swift/Kotlin)** | Highest | Highest | Yes | Games, AR, deep OS integration |

For most of you, the sweet spot is **Responsive Web → PWA → Capacitor** as your product grows. Start simple, upgrade when you have evidence you need to.

**Answer these questions in your submission** (a few sentences each):

1. **Where do your users need your product?** (At a desk? On the go? Both?)
2. **Does your product need device hardware?** (Camera, GPS, sensors, etc.)
3. **What is your platform decision?** Choose one:
   - **Web-only** — responsive web app, no app store
   - **PWA** — installable web app with offline support
   - **Capacitor** — web app wrapped for app store distribution
4. **Why?** Justify using the decision framework above
5. **What would change your mind?** What signal would cause you to upgrade (e.g., from web-only to PWA)?

**Deliverable:** Platform strategy writeup in your submission document.

#### Part 5: Loom Reflection Video

Record a 2-minute Loom video reflecting on your Sprint 3 work. In your video:

- **Demo your core feature** — show a user completing the main task
- **Share what you learned from user testing** — what surprised you? What broke?
- **Describe your top change** — what's the #1 thing you're going to fix based on feedback?
- **State your platform decision** and why

**Deliverable:** Add your Loom video URL to your submission document.

#### Portfolio Updates

By the Sprint 3 deadline, your portfolio should include:

- **Product spec documents** — as a page, downloadable PDF, or linked from your repo
- **Updated product link** — pointing to your live, functional app
- **Screenshots** — showing your core feature in action
- **User feedback summary** — a polished writeup of what you learned from testing

#### Turn In

Submit your completed Google Doc link on LearningSuite. Use the [Sprint 3 Submission Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14DCFSVRxwG4djSrESHcmspmy3z37scMhkmGpJSkGyPc/copy). Your doc should contain all links and written deliverables in one place:

1. GitHub repo URL (share with TAs if private)
2. Live product URL (Vercel)
3. GitHub URLs to your CLAUDE.md and spec documents
4. All 3 user test observation notes + AI synthesis
5. Loom URLs for each user test recording
6. Platform strategy writeup
7. Loom reflection video URL
8. Link to your updated portfolio

#### Grading Rubric (50 points)

## Peer Assignments

Peer assignments teach you to give and receive constructive feedback, a critical professional skill. You'll be randomly paired with different classmates for each assignment.

---

### Peer Code Review

**50 points | Assigned: Tue, Mar 10 | Due: Tue, Mar 17**

**Goal:** Apply code analysis skills to a peer's codebase and provide constructive feedback.

**Process:**

1. You'll be assigned a partner (different from your product testing partner)
2. Your partner shares their GitHub repo with you
3. You use Claude Code to analyze their codebase
4. You write a professional code review
5. You actually run and test their app

**Deliverables:**

**Part 1: AI-Assisted Analysis**

Run the following prompts in Claude Code on your peer's repo and save the outputs:

```markdown
Prompt 1: "Analyze this project structure. List all directories and their purposes,
identify frontend vs backend files, and count total lines of code.
Save as peer-review-structure.md"

Prompt 2: "Trace the main user flow from UI to database.
What happens when a user performs the core action?
Save as peer-review-dataflow.md"

Prompt 3: "Identify the architecture pattern, code organization,
and any potential security concerns or code smells.
Save as peer-review-architecture.md"
```

**Part 2: Written Review**

Write a 1-2 page review covering:

- **Architecture observations:** What patterns did you notice? How is the code organized?
- **Code quality:** What's done well? What could be cleaner?
- **Security considerations:** Any obvious vulnerabilities?
- **3 specific suggestions:** Actionable improvements with rationale

**Part 3: Kick the Tires**

- Sign up and use the app as a real user
- Document: Did it work? What broke? What was confusing?

**Turn in:**

- The 3 AI-generated markdown files
- Your written review (PDF or markdown)
- Brief notes from your testing session

**Grading Rubric (50 points)**

| Category | Points |
|----------|--------|
| AI analysis files complete and thorough | 15 |
| Written review professional and constructive | 20 |
| Testing notes with specific observations | 10 |
| Tone is helpful, not harsh | 5 |

::: {.callout-tip title="Code Review Mindset"}
Your goal is to help your peer improve, not to criticize. Frame feedback as "Have you considered..." or "One thing that might help..." Great code reviewers make others want to work with them.

### Peer Product Testing

**Week 12-13 | 50 points | Due: Thu, Apr 2**

**Goal:** Be a real test user for a peer's product and provide actionable UX feedback.

**Process:**

1. You'll be assigned a different partner than code review
2. You become an actual user of their product
3. You sign up, use core features, and try to break things
4. You document your experience and provide feedback

**Deliverables:**

**Part 1: Test Session Documentation**

Use the product for at least 20-30 minutes and document:

- **First impressions (30 seconds):** What did you think when you first landed on the app?
- **Signup/onboarding:** Was it smooth? Confusing? How long did it take?
- **Core task completion:** Try to complete the main action(s). Did it work?
- **Bugs found:** Screenshots + steps to reproduce
- **Confusing moments:** Where did you get stuck or have to think?
- **What worked well:** What was intuitive or delightful?

**Part 2: Feedback Summary**

Write up:

- 3 things that worked well (be specific)
- 3 prioritized improvement suggestions (most impactful first)
- Overall impression: Would you use this? Would you pay for it? Why or why not?

**Part 3: Video Walkthrough (Optional but encouraged)**

- 2-3 min Loom showing your testing session
- Narrate your thoughts as you use the app

**Turn in:**

- Test session documentation
- Feedback summary
- Video link (if recorded)

**Grading Rubric (50 points)**

| Category | Points |
|----------|--------|
| Thorough test documentation with specifics | 20 |
| Constructive feedback summary | 20 |
| Evidence of genuine engagement (not surface-level) | 10 |

::: {.callout-tip title="Testing Mindset"}
Your job is to help your peer see their product through fresh eyes. Be honest but kind. The best feedback is specific ("The button on the checkout page didn't respond when I clicked it") not vague ("The checkout was buggy").
