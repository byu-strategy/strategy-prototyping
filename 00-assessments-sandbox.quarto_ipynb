Psychologists call this the \"testing effect\" or \"retrieval practice\": when you pull ideas out of your head and put them into words, you strengthen your memory far more than by just rereading or listening. Writing answers to a few questions at the end of class also helps you notice what you do and don’t understand, making your study time more effective later. These quick Engagement Checks aren’t busywork, they’re a proven way to lock in the key ideas from class so you actually remember them.\n",
