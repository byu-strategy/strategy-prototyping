## Description

*Product Management/Creating Digital Products with AI: Strategy & Prototyping* immerses students in the evolving role of product managers in the era of AI-enabled innovation. This course combines strategic thinking with hands-on experimentation, giving students both the frameworks and the technical skills to envision, prototype, and launch AI-enhanced digital products.

Students will explore foundational concepts in product strategy, customer-centric design, and rapid iteration while learning how AI is transforming each stage of the product lifecycle. Core topics include identifying unmet customer needs, defining and validating minimum viable products (MVPs), accelerating prototyping, and gathering actionable user feedback.

In addition to standard product management tools such as GitHub, Jira, and Figma, students will work extensively with cutting-edge AI tools like Lovable, Replit, Cursor, and Claude Code. These tools enable them to ideate, design, and build at unprecedented speed, while gaining an understanding of how AI blurs traditional boundaries between product management, engineering, and design.

By the end of the semester, students will have developed, tested, and refined an AI-enabled product.

## Purpose

This course develops students’ ability to integrate strategic thinking and technical execution to deliver products that create genuine value for others.

## Classroom Culture

### Mission and Aims

The mission of Brigham Young University — founded, supported, and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life. That assistance should provide a period of intensive learning in a stimulating setting where a commitment to excellence is expected and the full realization of human potential is pursued.

BYU seeks to develop students of faith, intellect, and character who have the skills and the desire to continue learning and to serve others throughout their lives.

A BYU education should be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service.

Building on the foundational Mission and Aims, the Marriott School of Business aspires to transform the world through Christlike leadership by developing leaders of faith, intellect, and character guided by the following 4 values:

-   **Faith in Christ** - We value deep and abiding faith in Jesus Christ. Our faith gives us the capacity to envision a better future, the confidence to make that future happen, and the courage to act in the face of challenges.

-   **Integrity in Action** - We value integrity and hold ourselves to the highest moral and ethical standards. Acting with integrity builds trust, strengthens character, and focuses our ambitions on things of eternal consequence.

-   **Respect for All** - We value respect for all individuals as children of God and recognize the inherent worth, divine potential, and agency of each person. A climate of respect and belonging enhances our learning, facilitates collaboration, and encourages personal growth.

-   **Excellence** - We value excellence in learning, teaching, research, management, and leadership. An expectation of excellence magnifies our influence and motivates us to continually improve.

We evaluate our decisions and actions by the impact they will have on the academic experience, professional preparation, character development, emotional well-being, and spiritual growth of our students.

#### Prayer in class

We will begin each class with prayer. Each class member is invited to be voice for the prayer at least once throughout the semester. The TAs will reach out prior to class to invite you to pray on a particular day. If you'd rather not be voice for a prayer please let me know on the first day of class so I can instruct the TAs accordingly.

#### Laptop Policy

You may use laptops in class for note taking or other class related purposes. Laptops should not be used for activities that would be a distraction to nearby students when your screen is in their line of sight (e.g. sports, instagram, etc.)

#### Cold Calling

I teach in a conversational discussion based style, which includes cold calling students to ask for your input or to pose questions. If you'd rather I not cold call on you please let me know on the first day of class so that I can avoid doing so. I have deep respect for individual learning styles and will make accommodations when needed.

## Getting Help

The following resources are available to get help:

-   Start with AI chat bots and the course website to see if they can assist
-   Use the course Slack channel to ask classmates for help
-   Attend TA or Professor office hours
-   Use **Slack** or email to contact one of the course TAs
-   Use **Slack** or email to contact Professor Murff

## Honor Code

In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected to be honest in all of their academic work. Academic honesty means, most fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be your own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle may result in a failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary action by the university. Students are also expected to adhere to the Dress and Grooming Standards. Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others and ensures an effective learning and working environment. It is the university's expectation, and every instructor's expectation in class, that each student will abide by all Honor Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at 422-2847 if you have questions about those standards.

## Preventing & Responding to Sexual Misconduct

The health and well-being of students is of paramount importance at Brigham Young University. If you or someone you know has experienced sexual harassment (including sexual violence), there are many resources available for assistance.

In accordance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, BYU prohibits unlawful sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, against any participant in its education programs or activities. The university also prohibits sexual harassment by its personnel and students. Sexual harassment occurs when

a person is subjected to unwelcome sexual speech or conduct so severe, pervasive, and offensive that it effectively denies their ability to access any BYU education program or activity; any aid, benefit, or service of BYU is conditioned on a person’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct; or a person suffers sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking on the basis of sex. University policy requires all faculty members to promptly report incidents of sexual harassment that come to their attention in any way, including through face-to-face conversations, a written class assignment or paper, class discussion, email, text, or social media post. Incidents of sexual harassment should be reported to the Title IX Coordinator at t9coordinator\@byu.edu or (801) 422-8692 or 1085 WSC. Reports may also be submitted online at https://titleix.byu.edu/report or 1-888-238-1062 (24-hours a day).

BYU offers confidential resources for those affected by sexual harassment, including the university’s Sexual Assault Survivor Advocate, as well as a number of non-confidential resources and services that may be helpful. Additional information about Title IX, the university’s Sexual Harassment Policy, reporting requirements, and resources can be found at http://titleix.byu.edu or by contacting the university’s Title IX Coordinator.

## Student Disability

Brigham Young University is committed to providing a working and learning atmosphere that reasonably accommodates qualified persons with disabilities. A disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Whether an impairment is substantially limiting depends on its nature and severity, its duration or expected duration, and its permanent or expected permanent or long-term impact. Examples include vision or hearing impairments, physical disabilities, chronic illnesses, emotional disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety), learning disorders, and attention disorders (e.g., ADHD). If you have a disability which impairs your ability to complete this course successfully, please contact the University Accessibility Center (UAC), 2170 WSC or 801-422-2767 to request a reasonable accommodation. The UAC can also assess students for learning, attention, and emotional concerns. If you feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against on the basis of disability, please contact the Equal Opportunity Office at 801-422-5895, eo_manager\@byu.edu, or visit https://hrs.byu.edu/equal-opportunity for help.”
