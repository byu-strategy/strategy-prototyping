## AI Workflows

## Cursor Workflow

[Stanislav Beliaev CTO of GetFluently.App](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/stasbel_how-to-make-cursor-10x-more-useful-with-this-activity-7331676675308511232-ym7p/)

How to make Cursor 10x more useful with this one system ðŸ‘‡

At Fluently (AI English Coach â†’ https://getfluently.app) we use Cursor to streamline our development process.

By following these proven practices, you can ship features in hours, not days.

â†’ Before using Cursor:

â€¢ Ask Claude (or ChatGPT) to create a clear, detailed plan in markdown
â€¢ Have the AI ask clarifying questions, critique its own plan, and regenerate if needed
â€¢ Save this plan as "instructions. md" for easy reference during development.
â€¢ Use ChatGPT to add an extra planning layer before coding by another AI, reducing errors and complexity.

â†’ Workflow and incremental development:

Break work into small, manageable tasks or feature increments.

Use an Edit-Test loop:
1. Write a failing test case first (TDD approach).
2. Instruct AI to write code to pass the test.
3. Run the test.
4. If it fails, AI analyzes failure and fixes code.
5. Repeat until tests pass.

Review AI-generated changes after tests pass.
Encourage AI to explain its chain of thought in prompts.

â†’ Debugging

â€¢ If stuck, ask Cursor to generate a detailed report of all files and their roles, including errors.
â€¢ Use ChatGPT or Claude to analyze the report and suggest fixes.
â€¢ Use tools like gitingest.com to collect all scripts, configs, and relevant files in a single page for easier AI ingestion.
â€¢ Refer to the latest documentation via context7.com for up-to-date info.

â†’ Cursor-specific tips

â€¢ Use CursorRules to set broad project rules (always in AI context). Search Cursor Directory for examples.
â€¢ Typical rule: Write tests â†’ write code â†’ run tests â†’ update code until tests pass.
â€¢ Use /Reference open editors to quickly add files to AI context.
â€¢ Use cursorignore to exclude irrelevant files.
â€¢ Keep context short by explicitly adding files via @. Longer context can confuse AI.
â€¢ Start new chats when the context becomes too long.
â€¢ Resync or reindex code frequently to keep AI up to date.
â€¢ Notepads are useful for frequently used prompts.

â†’ Version control and file management

â€¢ Use Git often to commit changes regularly.
â€¢ Avoid large sets of uncommitted changes.
â€¢ Creating files and folders (e.g., touch, mkdir) is always acceptable.
â€¢ Running tests (Vitest, PM test, NR test, build, tsc) is always allowed.

â†’ Optional settings and modes

Enable YOLO mode to have AI write tests automatically.

Use a system prompt in "Rules for AI" in Cursor settings:
â€¢ Keep answers concise and direct.
â€¢ Suggest alternative solutions.
â€¢ Avoid unnecessary explanations.
â€¢ Prioritize technical details over generic advice.
